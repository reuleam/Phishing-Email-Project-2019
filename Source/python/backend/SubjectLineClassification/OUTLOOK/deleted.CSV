Pike to Binns Bobblehead

To forever commemorate the 2009 undefeated regular season, UC is creating a dual bobblehead of the game-winning Tony Pike to Armon Binns 29-yard touchdown which capped a 45-44 come-from-behind win at Pitt on Dec. 5, 2009.

The dual bobblehead features Pike delivering the pass and Binns in his iconic touchdown-celebration pose raising the football with an outstretched arm. The memento also includes an audio component which will play the radio and TV calls of the TD pass from the Voice of the Bearcats, Dan Hoard, and ESPN’s Sean McDonough.

All 2019 UC football season-ticket holders (one per ticket) will receive the bobblehead.

"Go Army","Hello Brayden,

My name is Sergeant Christopher Crabtree and I am an Army recruiter in the Cincinnati, OH area. I am reaching out to you today to extend an invitation to learn about some of the opportunities that the US Army has to offer. 

Many do not realize the amount of benefits that even a part time role in the Army Reserves has to offer. Are you looking for a way to fully fund, or perhaps partially fund your education? The cost of education can be a struggle. 

Some of the benefits that the Reserves offers include:

*        16 semester hours per year fully paid for by the Army

*        GI bill tuition assistance in excess of $25K 

*        Student Loan Repayment up to $50k

 

Reserves only requires one weekend of service per month and a two week training in the summer time.

If you have any questions regarding the US Army or any of the benefits feel free to ask!

Call/text/email to set up a time to sit down and discuss how you can qualify to earn the benefits that the Army has to offer.

 

Respectfully,

 

SGT Crabtree, Christopher

Pike was a first-team All-Big EAST Conference selection in 2009 after posting a league-leading 2,520 passing yards. Despite missing three games due to injury, Pike also led the BIG EAST in total offense--averaging 252.6 yards per game. He threw 29 touchdowns and helped the Bearcats to a 12-0 regular season and conference title.

For his career, Pike threw for 5,018 yards and 49 touchdowns, finishing fourth and second respectively on Cincinnati's all-time list.

Unknown To address 		


How to Fix It	 
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:	 

*	Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
*	Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
*	The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
*	Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.1 in Office 365 <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=389363> , and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

________________________________


More Info for Email Admins	 
Status code: 550 5.1.1 

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address outside of Office 365, but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 550 5.1.1 in Office 365 <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=389363> .

"Academic Use of Database","To Whom it May Concern,

 

Hello, I am currently working on a project for my software development class at the University of Cincinnati. My group is trying to create an application capable of detecting phishing email scams, but we cannot seem to find a good database of phishing scams. We came across your site and think it would be a perfect fit for our project, but given that we are broke college students we would not be able to afford a fee to use the database. We were wondering what your policy is on academic use of the database and if the fee is waived for non-commercial use. 

 

Thank You,

Brayden Osborne

Dear Bearcats Fan,

Our Cincinnati Bearcats Baseball team are AAC Champions! 

The University of Cincinnati baseball team won its first American Athletic Conference Championship and qualified for its first NCAA Tournament since 1974. They are headed to Corvallis, Oregon, where they will take on Oregon State on Friday night at 10:00 PM EST.

Earlier this season, a devoted and loyal former UC baseball player along with a local businessman, announced they would match any gift made to the UC Baseball program - dollar for dollar - up to $100,000. 

These funds will provide critical operational support to advance the competitive excellence of our UC Baseball team, including: 

•Upgrades at Marge Schott Stadium, which will help improve the current student-athlete experience, but also help with recruiting 
•Purchase of technology to help with performance 
•Needs for wellness, recovery and nutrition for student-athletes 
•Boosting the travel budget 

To date, we have raised 55% of the match. Help us close out the final 45% by making a gift to support your program! 

“The legacy we’re leaving, it’s been 45 years since we made a postseason run, this tournament win isn’t for us, this is for all the guys that came before us. It’s been 4 decades of teams that have gone through such trials and tribulations and blood, sweat and tears and really this win is for them, it’s not for us. They really sacrificed all they had... to give us the things that we have today.”  Redshirt Senior Pitcher, David Orndorff

You can donate by CLICKING HERE <http://gobearcats.fan-one.com/r/?id=had9a10f,850eb14,851ab70> . 

UC Baseball and the department of athletics wants to thank you for your support! 

Go Bearcats!

"[CEAS-UG] CEAS Tribunal Innovation Meeting - THIS THURSDAY 5:00 PM in 648 BALDWIN","Hello CEAS,

 

Thank you for your interest in joining the CEAS Tribunal Innovation committee. The poll results show that the best time to meet will be bi-weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Depending on student turnout, we might consider having weekly meetings to give you all more time to work on your projects, but the current plan is for meetings to be bi-weekly. Our first meeting will be THIS THURSDAY at 4:00 pm in 648 Baldwin, where we will be explaining the committee logistics, brainstorming innovation ideas, showing you all how to sign up for makerspace courses, and presenting a timeline for the Innovation Challenge. After that is finished, we will be traveling to the 1819 iHub Makerspace for an Orientation from 5:30 pm - 6:00 pm. It is very important you attend this orientation session as it is mandatory before you begin using the Makerspace. After this meeting, all following meetings will be focused on giving you time to work on your projects. Don't forget to bring your laptops to register for classes!



Again, CEAS Tribunal will be covering the costs of all materials you will use at the Makerspace. If you cannot make this meeting time, please do not hesitate to reach out so that we can reschedule another orientation! (Previous email is attached below for reference)

 

Best,

Hello CEAS,

 

Do you have an innovation idea, but don’t know where to start? Do you want to get trained and use the high-tech machinery available at the 1819 iHub Makerspace? Do you want the silicon, wood, metal, and all the other supplies provided for you to build your innovative project? Then join CEAS Tribunal’s Innovation Committee!

My name is Govind Krishna and I am the Innovation Co-chair for CEAS Tribunal, along with Chirag Agarwal. We are looking for dedicated CEAS Students with innovative ideas to join our committee and watch your ideas become reality. Throughout the semester, we will be taking this committee to the 1819 iHub Makerspace to get students orientated, and then regularly meet (at the makerspace) to work on your projects, get trained in the high-tech machinery, and ultimately finish your innovative project to be presented at the Innovation Challenge at the end of this semester. This innovative project can be done individually, or in small groups, and is completely up to your discretion on what you want to do, AT NO EXPENSE TO YOU!

CEAS Tribunal will cover the cost of the materials for you to create your innovation project, just show up to the committee meetings and get to work! Please fill out this poll if interested so we can find a meeting time that works best for everyone’s schedule.

Please fill out this poll if you're interested in being apart of CEAS Tribunal's innovation committee. We plan on meeting next week at a time dependent on the poll results below. We would enjoy hearing any innovative ideas you might have. Do not hesitate to reach out to the Innovation Co-Chairs if you have any questions: krishngd@mail.uc.edu, agrawacu@mail.uc.edu

This poll will show which machinery is available to get trained on, and asks about any innovative ideas that you might have (having an idea is not required but is highly recommended). 

 

If you are having difficulty coming up with an idea, here are some successful projects and pitches for companies completed through the MIT Launch Program:

Do you want the silicon, wood, metal, and all the other supplies provided for you to build your innovative project? Then join CEAS Tribunal’s Innovation Committee!



My name is Govind Krishna and I am the Innovation Co-chair for CEAS Tribunal, along with Chirag Agarwal. We are looking for dedicated CEAS Students with innovative ideas to join our committee and watch your ideas become reality. Throughout the semester, we will be taking this committee to the 1819 iHub Makerspace to get students orientated, and then regularly meet (at the makerspace) to work on your projects, get trained in the high-tech machinery, and ultimately finish your innovative project to be presented at the Innovation Challenge at the end of this semester. This innovative project can be done individually, or in small groups, and is completely up to your discretion on what you want to do, AT NO EXPENSE TO YOU!



CEAS Tribunal will cover the cost of the materials for you to create your innovation project, just show up to the committee meetings and get to work! Please fill out this poll if interested so we can find a meeting time that works best for everyone’s schedule.

This poll will show which machinery is available to get trained on, and asks about any innovative ideas that you might have (having an idea is not required but is highly recommended).


 

If you are having difficulty coming up with an idea, here are some successful projects and pitches for companies completed through the MIT Launch Program:

"[UCMC] West Virginia Backpacking Trip","Hello Fellow Mountaineers!




Are you looking to get outside for Memorial Day weekend (with your future co-pres and gear manager ??)? Our backpacking trip to Dolly Sods in West Virginia just had a few spots open up! For only $68 you will get an awesome multi-day backpacking trip and get views like this:










This trip is beginner+ (weather is good but it will definitely be a workout - email me if you are unsure if you are fit/experienced enough), so it is great if you are trying to get more into backpacking and push yourself beyond a 1-night trip in the RRG. Please email me for details on the itinerary, it can be flexible depending on people's schedule.




Once again, this trip just had spots open, so even if you are slightly interested, email or call me for details, it'll be first-come first-serve.




Thanks,

Pike to Binns Bobblehead

To forever commemorate the 2009 undefeated regular season, UC is creating a dual bobblehead of the game-winning Tony Pike to Armon Binns 29-yard touchdown which capped a 45-44 come-from-behind win at Pitt on Dec. 5, 2009.

The dual bobblehead features Pike delivering the pass and Binns in his iconic touchdown-celebration pose raising the football with an outstretched arm. The memento also includes an audio component which will play the radio and TV calls of the TD pass from the Voice of the Bearcats, Dan Hoard, and ESPN’s Sean McDonough.

All 2019 UC football season-ticket holders (one per ticket) will receive the bobblehead.

Athletics Names 2019 Hall of Fame Class, Bearcats Creating Pike to Binns Bobblehead 	
  	
  	
CINCINNATI – The University of Cincinnati Department of Athletics will enshrine one of the most successful football teams in school history into the James P. Kelly UC Athletics Hall of Fame along with its longtime radio voice, Director of Athletics Mike Bohn announced Monday. 

The 2009 University of Cincinnati football team, which finished with a perfect 12-0 regular season, won the BIG EAST Conference Championship and played in the 2010 Allstate Sugar Bowl, will be inducted alongside the Voice of the Bearcats, Dan Hoard. 

“We are thrilled to enhance the 10th Anniversary of the 2009 football season by inducting the team as a whole into the Hall of Fame,” Bohn said. “Adding the incomparable and iconic voice of Dan Hoard to this year’s class adds an inspirational dynamic in our salute to excellence. The achievements of the 2009 Bearcats, one of the greatest UC teams ever, are second-to-none in our football history and we look forward to unveiling additional exciting ways to commemorate their historic season. 

“Dan Hoard is simply one of the best broadcast professionals in the nation. We are blessed to have him as our respected voice of the Bearcats. He’s a phenomenal representative of the University with an unparalleled work ethic.” 

“I am honored, humbled, and quite honestly overwhelmed,"" Hoard said. ""Having a front row seat to watch Kenyon (Martin), Melvin (Levett), SK (Sean Kilpatrick), Gary (Clark), Jarron (Cumberland), Gino (Guidugli), Tony (Pike), Mardy (Gilyard), Connor (Barwin), Travis (Kelce) and so many other great players has been more than enough of a reward. Being the Voice of the Bearcats has been a joy and a privilege for 19 years. I look forward to many more to come.” 

While the 2009 team will be celebrated throughout the upcoming football season, the weekend of October 18-19, 2019 will feature the annual Legion of Excellence dinner on Friday and an in-game recognition during the football game against Tulsa on Saturday, Oct. 19 in Nippert Stadium. The team will be welcomed back to Cincinnati and former Head Coach Brian Kelly will attend the Saturday recognition.

To forever commemorate the 2009 undefeated regular season, UC is creating a dual bobblehead of the game-winning Tony Pike to Armon Binns 29-yard touchdown which capped a 45-44 come-from-behind win at Pitt on Dec. 5, 2009. 

The dual bobblehead features Pike delivering the pass and Binns in his iconic touchdown-celebration pose raising the football with an outstretched arm. The memento also includes an audio component which will play the radio and TV calls of the TD pass from the Voice of the Bearcats, Dan Hoard, and ESPN’s Sean McDonough. 

All 2019 UC football season-ticket holders will receive the dual bobblehead, one per ticket purchased. The only way to guarantee receiving one of the limited-edition items is to purchase 2019 season tickets which go on sale on Monday, May 13. The season-ticket book, also exclusive to season-ticket holders, features a dual 2009-2019 season-ticket design showcasing Bearcats stars of past and present. 

Students who purchase a season-ticket package for $70, which includes a limited edition Under Armour rUCkus t-shirt and gameday food vouchers, can add the bobblehead to their order for $10. Students who have already purchased season tickets can call the athletics ticket office to update their order. 

Anyone who has yet to renew their tickets for this season and new season ticket holders should contact the athletics ticket office at 1-877-CATS-TIX or online at GoBEARCATS.com/tickets. UC opens the 2019 campaign in primetime on ESPN against UCLA on Thursday, Aug. 29 in Nippert Stadium. 

More information on the Legion of Excellence will be released as it is finalized.

Athletics Names 2019 Hall of Fame Class, Bearcats Creating Pike to Binns Bobblehead 	
  	
  	
CINCINNATI – The University of Cincinnati Department of Athletics will enshrine one of the most successful football teams in school history into the James P. Kelly UC Athletics Hall of Fame along with its longtime radio voice, Director of Athletics Mike Bohn announced Monday. 

The 2009 University of Cincinnati football team, which finished with a perfect 12-0 regular season, won the BIG EAST Conference Championship and played in the 2010 Allstate Sugar Bowl, will be inducted alongside the Voice of the Bearcats, Dan Hoard. 

“We are thrilled to enhance the 10th Anniversary of the 2009 football season by inducting the team as a whole into the Hall of Fame,” Bohn said. “Adding the incomparable and iconic voice of Dan Hoard to this year’s class adds an inspirational dynamic in our salute to excellence. The achievements of the 2009 Bearcats, one of the greatest UC teams ever, are second-to-none in our football history and we look forward to unveiling additional exciting ways to commemorate their historic season. 

“Dan Hoard is simply one of the best broadcast professionals in the nation. We are blessed to have him as our respected voice of the Bearcats. He’s a phenomenal representative of the University with an unparalleled work ethic.” 

“I am honored, humbled, and quite honestly overwhelmed,"" Hoard said. ""Having a front row seat to watch Kenyon (Martin), Melvin (Levett), SK (Sean Kilpatrick), Gary (Clark), Jarron (Cumberland), Gino (Guidugli), Tony (Pike), Mardy (Gilyard), Connor (Barwin), Travis (Kelce) and so many other great players has been more than enough of a reward. Being the Voice of the Bearcats has been a joy and a privilege for 19 years. I look forward to many more to come.” 

While the 2009 team will be celebrated throughout the upcoming football season, the weekend of October 18-19, 2019 will feature the annual Legion of Excellence dinner on Friday and an in-game recognition during the football game against Tulsa on Saturday, Oct. 19 in Nippert Stadium. The team will be welcomed back to Cincinnati and former Head Coach Brian Kelly will attend the Saturday recognition. 	
  	
 <http://gobearcats.fan-one.com/r/?id=ha0431a0,7cc4255,7cc9b3a>  	
  	
To forever commemorate the 2009 undefeated regular season, UC is creating a dual bobblehead of the game-winning Tony Pike to Armon Binns 29-yard touchdown which capped a 45-44 come-from-behind win at Pitt on Dec. 5, 2009. 

The dual bobblehead features Pike delivering the pass and Binns in his iconic touchdown-celebration pose raising the football with an outstretched arm. The memento also includes an audio component which will play the radio and TV calls of the TD pass from the Voice of the Bearcats, Dan Hoard, and ESPN’s Sean McDonough. 

All 2019 UC football season-ticket holders will receive the dual bobblehead, one per ticket purchased. The only way to guarantee receiving one of the limited-edition items is to purchase 2019 season tickets which go on sale on Monday, May 13. The season-ticket book, also exclusive to season-ticket holders, features a dual 2009-2019 season-ticket design showcasing Bearcats stars of past and present. 

Students who purchase a season-ticket package for $70, which includes a limited edition Under Armour rUCkus t-shirt and gameday food vouchers, can add the bobblehead to their order for $10. Students who have already purchased season tickets can call the athletics ticket office to update their order. 

Anyone who has yet to renew their tickets for this season and new season ticket holders should contact the athletics ticket office at 1-877-CATS-TIX or online at GoBEARCATS.com/tickets. UC opens the 2019 campaign in primetime on ESPN against UCLA on Thursday, Aug. 29 in Nippert Stadium. 

More information on the Legion of Excellence will be released as it is finalized.

Thank You for Being Boldly Bearcat
Dear UC Community,

In this special year of our Bicentennial <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0012lNm_HTdGYibUk3mCd8dl04v5h3zuyg1yGr_y96JIFElNVbptYayaeA2pTqFqgK_5MwGSBgr41R9wxkLRSQdAAKspOZMkKBgzF2_QsLTxUpi87-Cn620l8pHVpWwxm5Sji-rbyymahs=&c=t7XGfS98NMbN8DTCK3-jt4NZKGRDCP1Kd-XN5UE2YxvY2acyedRA1g==&ch=WrS1DbBYL_ZRJDKS8Y8MHG1LKdLJmIRKfSpmH0ApCHYWsHnWowop4g==> , the 2018-19 academic year has been a clear reminder how the University of Cincinnati has grown from humble origins in 1819 to its stature today as a leading public urban university with local and global impact. 

As our Class of 2019 marches in UC’s four Commencement ceremonies in May, our academic community of nearly 46,000 students, more than 6,300 faculty, 4,100 staff members and 300,000 living alumni has so much to celebrate. Chief among our Boldly Bearcat accomplishments are our graduates and the record numbers of degrees awarded. Other key successes this year were the openings of our new 1MPACT House, 1819 Innovation Hub and the new home of the UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute, as well as UC’s designation among the world’s top 100 most innovative universities. 

Our faculty continue to prove just how world class they are with their many accolades and endeavors addressing societal challenges. Let me share a few examples:

A new Staff Senate has formed and is holding its first elections, while a Faculty Enrichment Center is preparing to open this fall with a focus on developing and retaining top faculty talent. As we strive to build our resource base, Provost Kristi Nelson recently convened an historic all-university meeting of deans, associate deans and academic department heads. This generated such an exciting discussion that another summit of academic leadership will take place next year.  

To enhance our efforts to address the new challenges and opportunities that arise through the digital realm, we have broken ground on a Digital Futures building for interdisciplinary teams of faculty, students and staff to collaborate with external partners.

Last August, we opened the year with new deans at three of our colleges – Timothy Jachna at DAAP, Robin Lightner at UC Blue Ash and Stanley Romanstein at CCM. As we look to the new academic year ahead, we will again welcome new faces. Two deans have been announced already – Verna Williams, a member of the UC law faculty since 2001, has been appointed its first African American female dean effective April 1, and Marianne Lewis, now dean of the Cass business school at City, University of London, will become the first female dean of our Lindner College of Business on July 1. Searches for new deans of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and the McMicken College of Arts and Sciences are expected to finish up with announcements on selections in the weeks ahead. In athletics, we have just welcomed our new UC men’s basketball coach John Brannen, who is ready to lead the Bearcats into their second year at the newly renovated Fifth Third Arena. 

We will also mark the openings of two new buildings this fall: the Lindner College of Business and the Health Sciences Building. Please join us as our Bicentennial celebration continues on Nov. 8-9 with our Bicentennial Bash and Homecoming.

I want you to know how grateful I am to each of you for making UC’s success possible. Have a wonderful summer. I hope you will find time for some relaxation.

With appreciation,
 
Neville G. Pinto
President

The results of this survey have been actively used to make continued improvements to UC’s advising program, including more advisors, new technologies, and changes in advising models to align with student needs.

"[UCMC] Friday May 3rd & Sunday May 5th Flying Pig, HELP WANTED","Hello UCMC'ers!  

It’s Katrina, your volunteer secretary, and I just wanted to reach out to all of you regarding volunteering with us for the Flying Pig Marathon. We still need some people to meet our required minimum, so I just thought I’d hit y’all with the deets in case you need volunteer hours, or if you are looking for something to do this weekend! There are two shifts that we need to fill, so heres my plug: 

EVENT DETAILS:


1) Friday Night Details: (May 3rd)
Event: Fifty West one mile event on Friday, May 3rd (previously our Little Kings Mile... just a new sponsor and new beer)
Volunteer Needs: Volunteers to help ice down beer (similar to last year) on Mehring Way just east of the Roebling Suspension Bridge. Volunteers will be asked to ""babysit/ watch"" the beer so it stays covered and un-touched until the finish line group arrives around 7pm. At this time the group will head to the post-race event (in Smale Riverfront Park) and assist with the greening/ clean up for this event. Volunteer task will be finished by 11pm

# of volunteers: 8

Time: 4:00p-11pm

Location: Mehring Way and into Smale Riverfront Park

2) Sunday race day (May 5th)
Event: Post-race support
Volunteer Needs: volunteers to help in our Flying Pig booth to hand out shirts and giveaways to the finishers of the 3-way and 4-way events
# of volunteers: 8-10 at all times
Time: 7am-2pm (will most likely end closer to noon or be able to have only 2-3 stay past noon)
Location: Smale Riverfront Park

There will be carpooling from campus, so do not fret if you don’t have a car! If you are available to help out for either of these events, please shoot me an email at zielonka@mail.uc.edu <mailto:zielonka@mail.uc.edu>  !!!!!! We still need approximately 3-5 more people for each shift. Thanks!

Good luck with finals!<3,

Spring Neighborhood

Enhancement Program

April 27th



Description 

Join the Center for Community Engagement, Keep Cincinnati Beautiful, and the City of Cincinnati for the 2019 Spring Neighborhood Enhancement Program volunteer blitz. This year's program takes us to the communities of Camp Washington and South Cumminsville, just steps from UC's Uptown campus.

UC volunteers will meet at McMicken Circle (near University Pavilion) and travel together to a designated meeting location in the neighborhoods on school buses. There, volunteers will participate in the kick-off ceremony and break into teams to address projects identified by the community's local residents for the Neighborhood Enhancement Program (NEP). Volunteers will help kick-off the NEP in Camp Washington and South Cumminsville by performing various service and beautification projects such as gardening, cleaning up illegal dump sites, painting fire hydrants and murals, cutting back overgrown brush, and more.

Finneytown AfterProm

REGISTER BY APRIL 26TH!!!

Description

This is the most fun shift!!  The students who sign up for this shift always say they have a lot of fun even though this involves staying up all night. These students are assigned to various places in the event--maybe as dealers in the casino room, or manning the obstacle course or laser tag. Sign up with a friend and we will try to put you together. This shift involves interacting with the high school students.

 

Please wear nicer clothes and no flip flops as our high school students must adhere to a dress code. Our high school is located less than 20 minuted north of UC's campus--transportation is not provided, but students often carpool.  You will get breaks during which you get the same food that our high school students get to eat--great perk!

Quick plugs:

 

One. Please please please fill out any/all surveys coming your way. This includes your course evals, advising surveys, senior surveys…UC is sending out a bunch, I know. I beg you to take the time to fill them out. They really really help us to create change. We truly utilize your feedback. Promise. And Two. If you aren’t enrolled for the fall term (and plan to take courses) please set up an appointment with your advisor ASAP so we can take care of that before you leave. https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/advising.html

 

And a quick note:

 

This year has been wild and new for me here in CEAS. As it ends, I want to put out a positive insight for you all. I have been in higher education for 20 years and at UC for 15 years and I have never known a more motivated group of students nor a college of students that organizes and supports one another more than you all do. I have been very energized and uplifted by how strong, inventive, and involved you all are with your student groups, peers, and activities here in CEAS. Your programming and participation is enormous in events that not only showcase your academics but support one another with a culture of inclusion, with empathy, with creativity, and …well…with food (I never knew how much I loved grilled cheese). 

 

Thank you. You all have a passion for and are vocal about your curriculum, your faculty, your facilities, and your need for supports and continuous improvements. We hear you and hope to match your vigor and passion. Thanks so much for being so welcoming and for being so strong of a team. I truly appreciate you all.

 

Best wishes for the end of the academic year and I hope folks have a great summer. Take care of yourselves and each other. 

 

And I don’t know what this bitmoji is saying really…but I’m knee deep in Game of Thrones and it made me laugh so…

"[CEAS-EECS-UG] First Edition of the EECS Student Magazine!","Hello!

Over the past couple weeks, we've been working on a student magazine for EECS. The goal of the magazine is to highlight work that students in EECS are doing - for home projects, school, research, student groups, and more. Our goal is to showcase both technical work and accounts of experiences the students have. 

We're very proud of this first edition, which is attached. I had a ton of help from Dr. Cahay, Dr. Fuchs, Dr. Mantei, Teresa Hamad, Tyler Westland, those in IEEE, and of course, all of the authors, to make this happen. 

Please give it a quick read to see what's going on in EECS - you have some amazingly capable peers!

I'll print out a few color versions of this to have in the 802 office that you may read if you like. Feel free to stop by and talk about it anytime. We will be continuing this magazine every semester, so look out for emails on how to submit next Fall.

Thanks,

"[CEAS-UG] Outreach Project - Holly Hills - Fulfills Community Service Hours","Happy Tuesday CEAS Bearcats!!

 

I hope you are enjoying the warmer weather. I have an outreach program with Holly Hills Family Services on May 9th from 9am-2pm at the California, KY location. The outreach project includes landscaping on the property (mulching, weeding, planting flowers, trimming hedges, etc). If any student has community service hours that needs to be filled for scholarships such as Cincinnatus, this will qualify. Please keep in mind that you don’t have to be there the entire time. You are welcome to help out for an hour or two. If you are interested, please let me know.  I have included information on Holly Hills Family Services below. 

 

From 1996 to present, Holly Hill has worked diligently to provide a continuum of care for the children it serves. The addition of new programs has allowed the agency to increase the number of children it has served from 40 in 1997 to more than 650 children and family members in 2006. To better define the agency and the programs it offers, the Board of Director voted in 1999 to change the agency name to Holly Hill Children’s Services to incorporate three additional programs: Therapy Services, Case Management, and Supervised Visitation.  In 2017, Holly Hill once again updated their name to reflect the type of care they are providing.  Today, Holly Hill Child & Family Solutions, with offices in California, Kentucky and Highland Heights, Kentucky offers four areas of programming to benefit families in Northern Kentucky. In fiscal 2017, Holly Hill Child & Family Solutions served 3,000+ children and families.

The end of the spring semester is approaching.  Don't forget to rate your advisor by completing the survey below.  If you have already completed the survey, please disregard this email.

Most of these companies are then interested in recruiting the students at graduation.  

 

If you’re interested, be sure to select these companies in PAL so they receive your resume.  If you have questions, let me know.  If you get an interview, I’ll be happy to talk with you about how to talk with them about the ICP.

There were harrowing stories about how they had to build a new road, push their van out of the mud, and wrote a song about their trip. It sounded like a trip I would have loved to be on.

Description

Join the Center for Community Engagement, Keep Cincinnati Beautiful, and the City of Cincinnati for the 2019 Spring Neighborhood Enhancement Program volunteer blitz. This year's program takes us to the communities of Camp Washington and South Cumminsville, just steps from UC's Uptown campus.

"[UC-AAS] Reminder! Rate your UC Advisor!","UC Student,

This is a reminder to complete the UC Advising Experience Survey.  If you have already completed the survey, please disregard this email.

My office, UC’s Office of Advising & Academic Services, is seeking UC student feedback about the quality of advising that you have received this year. The results will be disseminated to each of the colleges and advising centers at UC. This helps us to stay abreast of individual advisor performance, college or advising unit quality, and overall university support. The results of this survey have been actively used to make continued improvements to UC’s advising program, including more advisors, new technologies, and changes in advising models to align with student needs.

UC Advising Experience Survey 2019 <https://ucir.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0p0QWnoT08FGeMJ>

Please help us continue to recognize good advising and help us understand where we can improve. Every response will be read and carefully considered. The survey should take no longer than five minutes to complete.

John Brannen Named Cincinnati Men's Basketball Coach	
  	
John Brannen <http://gobearcats.fan-one.com/r/?id=h929d83b,7507e5c,750ddd8> has been named the 27th head coach in University of Cincinnati men's basketball history, Director of Athletics Mike Bohn announced Sunday, April 14. A formal introduction will take place Monday.

Brannen has served as Northern Kentucky University's head coach since the 2015-2016 season, taking the Norse to unprecedented success as the school's athletics department underwent reclassification. Since earning active Division I status eligibility prior to the start of the 2016-17 season, the Norse men's basketball program has compiled a 72-30 overall record, making three consecutive postseason appearances (NCAA Tournament [2017, 2019], NIT [2018]), winning back-to-back Horizon League regular-season championships (2018, 2019) and claiming a pair of conference tournament titles (2017, 2019). No other school in the nation has enjoyed NKU's amount of success in its first three years with active status at the Division I level. 

""We are thrilled to welcome John, his wife Lisa and their daughters, Jaylee and Katelyn, to the Bearcats family,"" Bohn said. ""He has a proven record as a head coach, longtime ties to the local community and coaches an exciting style of basketball. We were impressed with his passion, drive, determination and basketball acumen during the interview process where he truly emerged as the best coach to lead the Cincinnati basketball program with a bright future."" 

Brannen, whose coaching career spans 20 seasons, owns an 82-52 career record as head coach. He registered an 81-51 ledger in four seasons at NKU and a 1-1 mark as Alabama's interim head coach at the end of the 2014-15 campaign. 

The 2017 Horizon League Coach of the Year, Brannen led the Norse to a 24-11 record in 2016-17, the Horizon League Tournament title and an appearance in the NCAA Tournament in the school's first season of active status eligibility. NKU's win total was an improvement of 15 victories from the previous season, marking the third-best turnaround in the nation behind only UCLA and Minnesota.  

Brannen guided NKU to a 22-10 mark, the Horizon League regular-season championship and an NIT appearance in 2017-18. Last season, NKU posted a Division I-era record 26 wins with eight losses, claiming the league regular-season championship and tournament title and its second NCAA Tournament appearance in three years. 

""It's truly an honor to take over such a storied program at the University of Cincinnati,"" Brannen said. ""The Cincinnati-northern Kentucky community is special to my family and we are happy to remain at home. I want to thank President Pinto, Mike Bohn and the search committee for this opportunity. We are thrilled to join a world-class University and continue to build on the historic success of Bearcats basketball and the incredible lineage of former coaches.""

Brannen's players have earned 10 Horizon League postseason accolades, highlighted by Drew McDonald receiving league player of the year honors this past season. NKU finished 2018-19 ranked 11th in the nation in both total assists (592) and assists per game (16.9). The Norse also ranked nationally in field goal shooting percentage (27th at .478), scoring margin (28th at +9.6), assist-to-turnover ratio (32nd at 1.34), three-point shooting defense (34th at .314), rebound margin (43rd at +4.5) and scoring offense (44th at 78.5 points).

Brannen came to NKU after spending six seasons (2010-2015) at Alabama coaching under Anthony Grant, four as an assistant coach and two as the associate head coach. The Crimson Tide made four postseason appearances during his stay. Alabama finished as the runners up at the 2011 NIT, posting a 25-12 overall mark and winning the Southeastern Conference West Division title. The Crimson Tide made an NCAA Tournament appearance the following season and later advanced to the NIT quarterfinals in 2013 and the second round of the NIT in 2015. Brannen served as interim head coach for Alabama's two games in the 2015 NIT. While in Tuscaloosa, Brannen helped sign Alabama's 2011 recruiting class that ranked fifth in the nation according to Rivals.com. 

Prior to Alabama, Brannen served as an assistant coach at VCU for three seasons (2007-09) under Anthony Grant, helping lead the Rams to three 20-win campaigns, two NCAA Tournament appearances (2007, 2009) and a showing in the NIT (2008). The 2007 squad posted a 28-7 mark, upsetting Duke in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Brannen helped recruit Larry Sanders, who later was drafted by Milwaukee as the 15th pick in the 2010 NBA draft and also helped recruit four of VCU's five starters on its 2011 Final Four team. 

Brannen also was an assistant coach at St. Bonaventure (2004-06) for three seasons, Eastern Kentucky (2001-2003) for three seasons and Charleston for the 2000 campaign.   

A native of nearby Alexandria, Ky., Brannen attended Newport Central Catholic High School. He began his collegiate playing career at Morehead State before transferring to Marshall for his final two seasons, playing for head coaches Billy Donovan (1996) and Greg White (1997). He was named the Southern Conference Player of the Year as a senior in 1997, averaging 20.9 points. He scored 1,008 points in two seasons with the Thundering Herd. A Rhodes Scholar finalist, Brannen received scholarships from both the NCAA and Southern Conference. He earned a degree in business management from Marshall in 1997 and played two seasons of professional basketball in Belgium's First Division before beginning his coaching career. 

Brannen and his wife Lisa live in northern Kentucky and are the proud parents of twin daughters, Jaylee and Katelyn.

Prior to Alabama, Brannen served as an assistant coach at VCU for three seasons (2007-09) under Anthony Grant, helping lead the Rams to three 20-win campaigns, two NCAA Tournament appearances (2007, 2009) and a showing in the NIT (2008). The 2007 squad posted a 28-7 mark, upsetting Duke in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Brannen helped recruit Larry Sanders, who later was drafted by Milwaukee as the 15th pick in the 2010 NBA draft and also helped recruit four of VCU's five starters on its 2011 Final Four team. 

Brannen also was an assistant coach at St. Bonaventure (2004-06) for three seasons, Eastern Kentucky (2001-2003) for three seasons and Charleston for the 2000 campaign.   

A native of nearby Alexandria, Ky., Brannen attended Newport Central Catholic High School. He began his collegiate playing career at Morehead State before transferring to Marshall for his final two seasons, playing for head coaches Billy Donovan (1996) and Greg White (1997). He was named the Southern Conference Player of the Year as a senior in 1997, averaging 20.9 points. He scored 1,008 points in two seasons with the Thundering Herd. A Rhodes Scholar finalist, Brannen received scholarships from both the NCAA and Southern Conference. He earned a degree in business management from Marshall in 1997 and played two seasons of professional basketball in Belgium's First Division before beginning his coaching career. 

Brannen and his wife Lisa live in northern Kentucky and are the proud parents of twin daughters, Jaylee and Katelyn.

April 27th Spring Neighborhood Enhancement Program

 

 Description

Join the Center for Community Engagement, Keep Cincinnati Beautiful, and the City of Cincinnati for the 2019 Spring Neighborhood Enhancement Program volunteer blitz. This year's program takes us to the communities of Camp Washington and South Cumminsville, just steps from UC's Uptown campus.

There, volunteers will participate in the kick-off ceremony and break into teams to address projects identified by the community's local residents for the Neighborhood Enhancement Program (NEP). Volunteers will help kick-off the NEP in Camp Washington and South Cumminsville by performing various service and beautification projects such as gardening, cleaning up illegal dump sites, painting fire hydrants and murals, cutting back overgrown brush, and more.

"[CEAS-UG] Reminder - 2019 Call for nominations -  Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award","Good Morning,

 

This email serves as a reminder that the deadline to submit Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff nominations is this Friday, April 12 at 5:00pm.  Please see the original email below.

 

Thank you,

 

Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award Committee

 

 

From: CEAS Dean's Office (ceasdean) 
Sent: Wednesday, April 03, 2019 2:14 PM
Subject: 2019 Call for nominations - Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award

 

Dear CEAS Faculty, Staff, and Students,

 

The College of Engineering and Applied Science Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award Committee is accepting nominations from faculty, students, and staff for the 2019 Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award.  

  

Largely unsung, it is the staff of the College who conduct much of the behind-the-scenes effort necessary for the College to fulfill its mission and have an impact on the community and on our students. The McCormick Distinguished Staff Award recognizes the contributions of the staff and is given each year to a CEAS staff member who, in the committee's judgment, has demonstrated exemplary service that has significantly contributed to and furthered the mission of the College of Engineering and Applied Science, as well as the core values of the University of Cincinnati.

 

The nomination should consist of the following:  

*	A cover sheet that includes name, title, length of service, and a one-paragraph job description (approximately 50 words or less). 
*	A one-page nominating letter from a person who is a member of the College community.  The committee urges that specific information about how the nominee serves the College in his or her job be included in the letter of nomination and the supporting material.

*	Up to four additional pages of information, either in the form of letters or simple text.  Letters must be signed; text must indicate the contributor’s name.  This additional information can be from someone in the College or from an outside source.  Specific instances of the person going beyond his/her job description will be appreciated.

 

Please see the attached documents for eligibility requirements and additional information.

            

The award recipient will be announced Spring semester.

 

The deadline for nominations is 5:00 PM, Friday, April 12, 2019.  Nominations should be emailed to katy.markley@uc.edu.

 

Thank you,

Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award Committee

"Opportunities with the U.S. Army and Army Reserves","Hello Brayden, 

 

My name is SFC Emmerich with the U.S. Army and Army Reserves as your local U.S. Army representative. I would like to tell you about the many opportunities the Army has to offer. Whether your focus is attending college or joining the workforce, the Army has more than 150 career fields and numerous financial programs to help you make the most of your life.

 

Qualified Active Duty applicants can earn up to and over $100,000 for continuing education through the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, may qualify for a signing bonus of up to $25,000, and receive tuition assistance to pay for college while serving on Active Duty.

 

Qualified Reserves applicants can earn up to $46,000 for continuing education through the Reserves Montgomery G.I. Bill, up to $50,000 to repay student loans, tuition assistance to help pay for college while serving, and may qualify for a signing bonus of up to $20,000. The Reserves are part-time, requiring you too do training one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer. You can still work and go to school full time.  You can even be stationed with a Reserve unit in the Cincinnati Area, making it easy to work, go to school, and attend your training.

 

Of course, the benefits of joining the U.S. Army go beyond just the monetary. In addition to becoming a stronger individual as you gain new training, you’ll also feel a sense of accomplishment, experience true camaraderie, and develop leadership skills employers’ value.

 

If you are interested in receiving more information about the U.S. Army or just have some questions, my contact information can be found below. Feel free to call, text, or reply to this email. Thank you for your time.

"[UCMC] Upcoming Trips!","Hey Everyone!




Last night we were in 525 Old Chem talking about the Superstition Wilderness Spring Break trip! It sure looked like a lot of fun with plenty of mischief. Apparently UCMC has a cult worshiping a cactus after their escapades in the desert. Afterwards a big group of people went bowling after the meeting too!




Next week we are headed to RRT for our annual Raffle and Bottomless Beer + Ale8 night! For $20 those 21+ can get bottomless beer and those under 21 can get bottomless Ale8 both with a stainless mug! There will be a bunch of things that will be raffled off and I believe if you buy $20 of raffle tickets you can get a string of lights for your hammocks! We will be having a lot of drivers to drive people to and from the event as well. We will be meeting at the Gear Cave at 6:00 and leaving by 6:45





Now the part you all love to see every week: Upcoming Trips!

April 27th Spring Neighborhood Enhancement Program

 

 Description

Join the Center for Community Engagement, Keep Cincinnati Beautiful, and the City of Cincinnati for the 2019 Spring Neighborhood Enhancement Program volunteer blitz. This year's program takes us to the communities of Camp Washington and South Cumminsville, just steps from UC's Uptown campus.

UC volunteers will meet at McMicken Circle (near University Pavilion) and travel together to a designated meeting location in the neighborhoods on school buses. There, volunteers will participate in the kick-off ceremony and break into teams to address projects identified by the community's local residents for the Neighborhood Enhancement Program (NEP). Volunteers will help kick-off the NEP in Camp Washington and South Cumminsville by performing various service and beautification projects such as gardening, cleaning up illegal dump sites, painting fire hydrants and murals, cutting back overgrown brush, and more.

April 26th–28th Finneytown After Prom



Description

AfterProm provides a safe environment for high school students to enjoy after the night of prom. Our high school is located less than 20 minuted north of UC's campus.  Transportation is not provided, but students often carpool.

 

Opportunities

*       Friday Set Up (Friday 5pm-11:30pm)

o   This shift is preparing the school areas used for the activities for our After-Prom. This will include moving furniture, putting up sheets of plastic, and decorating. Some of the work will involve lifting and carrying props; some students will be on ladders. A homemade meal is provided for all workers!

*       Saturday Set Up (Saturday 10am-4pm)

o   This shift includes our outside decorating which may involve using power tools, for those who have experience with that. It also involves finishing any decorating on the inside in the areas used for our After-Prom. This may mean standing on a ladder and other physical labor. Pizza is provided for those who work this shift!

*       Working the Event (Saturday Night 10:30pm-5am)

o   The students who sign up for this shift always say they have a lot of fun even though this involves staying up all night. These students are assigned to various places in the event--maybe as dealers in the casino room, or manning the obstacle course or laser tag. Sign up with a friend and we will try to put you together. This shift involves interacting with the high school students. You will get breaks during which you get the same food that our high school students get to eat--great perk!

*       Tear Down (Sunday 11am-5pm)

o   This shift involves taking down all the decorations and plastic, moving the furniture back to its original spot, and placing all the decorations back in our storage facility. This involves lifting and some will be on ladders. Pizza lunch is provided!

Summer Great Parks of Hamilton County



Description

Are you looking for volunteer opportunities this summer? Is your school seeking service-learning projects that promote conservation and stewardship in the great outdoors?

 

Visit the Great Parks volunteer website <https://www.greatparks.org/get-involved/volunteer>  to learn more about how you can get volunteer at Great Parks, including:

 

*       Service-Learning for school groups:  Bring your school to a Great Park for a day of service. The next application deadline is July 1, so if your school is interested in a summer or fall field trip and project apply here soon.

 

*       Long-term volunteer opportunities:   Students interested in volunteer opportunities ranging from trail work and stewardship to golf or fishing camps and help at our riding center and Parky’s Farm can apply here to get started <https://www.greatparks.org/get-involved/volunteer/long-term-volunteering> . We ask long-term volunteers to fill out an application, register for an orientation and commit to approximately 30 hours of volunteer work a year.

 

*       One-Time Volunteer Opportunities:  Anyone who wants to make a difference but doesn’t have the time for a longer commitment can pop in for one of our Saturday conservation projects! They generally last from 9 a.m. – noon and students can bring family and friends. Be sure to check out the Winton Woods Cleanup, featuring our high school challenge! The school that brings the largest group to the cleanup will earn an hour canoe or kayak rental for all participants (along with the glory of victory, of course)! Click here to see all the conservation projects on the horizon. <https://reservations.greatparks.org/Info.aspx?EventID=1300>

"[CEAS-UG] 2019 Call for nominations -  Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award","Dear CEAS Faculty, Staff, and Students,

 

The College of Engineering and Applied Science Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award Committee is accepting nominations from faculty, students, and staff for the 2019 Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award.  

  

Largely unsung, it is the staff of the College who conduct much of the behind-the-scenes effort necessary for the College to fulfill its mission and have an impact on the community and on our students. The McCormick Distinguished Staff Award recognizes the contributions of the staff and is given each year to a CEAS staff member who, in the committee's judgment, has demonstrated exemplary service that has significantly contributed to and furthered the mission of the College of Engineering and Applied Science, as well as the core values of the University of Cincinnati.

 

The nomination should consist of the following:  

*	A cover sheet that includes name, title, length of service, and a one-paragraph job description (approximately 50 words or less). 
*	A one-page nominating letter from a person who is a member of the College community.  The committee urges that specific information about how the nominee serves the College in his or her job be included in the letter of nomination and the supporting material.

*	Up to four additional pages of information, either in the form of letters or simple text.  Letters must be signed; text must indicate the contributor’s name.  This additional information can be from someone in the College or from an outside source.  Specific instances of the person going beyond his/her job description will be appreciated.

 

Please see the attached documents for eligibility requirements and additional information.

            

The award recipient will be announced Spring semester.

 

The deadline for nominations is 5:00 PM, Friday, April 12, 2019.  Nominations should be emailed to katy.markley@uc.edu.

 

Thank you,

Mary McCormick Distinguished Staff Award Committee

Dear Bearcats Fan,

UC Day of Giving is well under way. We have raised $24,331 thus far thanks to the generous support of 129 donors, but we aren't done yet!

UCATS won the Early Bird Challenge and received an additional $500 bonus and we want to continue that trend! Starting at 5:00 PM EDT, the Day of Giving Happy Hour Challenge will begin. The fund with the most donors between 5:00 and 8:00 will receive an extra $500 and we need your help to make sure that goes to support our Bearcats student-athletes! 

Any gift to athletics makes a difference in the lives of our 500 student-athletes in 19 sports! If you choose to donate today, you can double your impact by supporting the UCATS General Fund. A matching gift of up to $10,000 will be made thanks to the Estate of Svet & Marvy Nankovitch. 

You can make your gift now by CLICKING HERE <http://gobearcats.fan-one.com/r/?id=h863adcd,70f90bf,710180c> !

Thank you for your support of Bearcats Athletics!

"[CEAS-UG] REMINDER: UC Rocketry Club Build Day","Hello All!

This is a reminder that the UC Rocketry Club has a build day tomorrow at 12PM noon in Old Chem 518. For your safety, in order to allow you to use our tools, we require that you pass a few online quizzes at https://ehs.uc.edu/webtrain/webtrain.asp?shell=fmconst. Before we can allow you to use our tools, we need you to take the following:

*	Electrical Safety
*	Hazard Communication
*	Hazardous Waste
*	Hot Work
*	Noise
*	Powered Tools
*	SPCC
*	PPE

We also recommend Lead and Respirators, but those are not required. Please don’t let this list intimidate you. These quizzes are very quick. Taking them will also allow you to use the machine shop on 4th floor Rhodes. For each one, you simply click through a short few slides of information and take the quiz. We simply need you to show us your certificates or your transcripts. It’s best if you simply print this page: https://ehs.uc.edu/itc/transcript.asp and bring it with you. You can also email me a screenshot of it. Just make sure that whatever document you provide includes your name. If you can’t take these quizzes before the start of the build, we will have a computer available for you to use. If you’ve already taken the quizzes and provided documentation to us within the past calendar year, you don’t need to take them again. 

 

With that out of the way, I’m excited to build with all of you tomorrow! If you’ve never built a model rocket before or you’re used to small Estes kits, you’re certainly in for a treat.

 

If you can’t make it but still want to get involved, please send an email to one of our officers:

*	Myself, Nate Moorman, President – moormanj@mail.uc.edu <mailto:moormanj@mail.uc.edu> 
*	Aaron Jones, Vice President – jones5ao@mail.uc.edu <mailto:jones5ao@mail.uc.edu>

"[CEAS-EECS-UG] IEEE Meeting 4/4/19: Student Magazine","Hello,


Apologies for using the EECS wide listserv as our listserv is currently experiencing difficulties with spam somehow going out so I have shut it down.

We will be having a meeting next Thursday, April 4th, at 5:00pm in CRC3250. IEEE is starting up a Student Magazine to highlight work done by students - at home, in class, or doing research! Any kind of project that you were excited about counts. This magazine is still very much a work in progress, so we'll be discussing what our plans for it are.

This meeting will again be a short one, but we will also be accepting nominations for exec for next year, voting on bylaw changes, and having a Q & A on any questions you may have about exec. If you're interested in running, please attend, or send me an email if you cannot m

Gear cave will open half an hour early (5:30-7pm) so that the spring break trips can return their gear! 

There’s a lot of you so please plan wisely—CLEAN your gear and be aware that many of your things may have been mixed up during your trip (trekking poles, sleeping pads...). YOU are ultimately responsible for the specific piece of gear you checked out, so if you bring back the wrong pack cover or something, talk to your trip buddies!

If you can’t return your gear on time, please communicate with your trip leader or our gear guru, Brett. 

Can’t wait to hear about your adventures!

Bearcats Fans Encouraged To Purchase NCAA Tickets On StubHub

 

CINCINNATI – The University of Cincinnati’s ticket allotment for the NCAA Tournament first round in Columbus has officially sold out, but Bearcats fans who purchase their tickets through StubHub are eligible for a special ticket drawing.

 

Patrons who email their StubHub confirmation to uctickets@uc.edu <mailto:uctickets@uc.edu>  will be entered in a drawing to win two (2) tickets to the UC football game at Ohio State on Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019 inside Ohio Stadium in Columbus.

 

UC (28-6) is the No. 7 seed in the South Region, taking on No. 10 Iowa (22-11) at 12:15 p.m. ET Friday at Nationwide Arena.

 

“We are excited to see a lot of red and black in Nationwide Arena this Friday,” Director of Athletics Mike Bohn said. “We received a limited amount of lower-level tickets, only about 300 seats for the public and it’s not enough to take care of all of our phenomenal fans who deserve to be rewarded for their support! We encourage everyone to utilize StubHub for the NCAA Tournament seats. They’ve been a great partner for UC this season as we enjoyed record levels of fan support in our return to Fifth Third Arena.”

 

UC Athletics is proud to partner with StubHub, the 'Official Fan to Fan Ticket Marketplace' of the Bearcats Athletics. Fans who are seeking to purchase tickets for UC’s NCAA Tournament games are encouraged to utilize StubHub. Click HERE <http://gobearcats.fan-one.com/r/?id=h7ea86c1,6ba91af,6bf1324>  to buy seats today! 

 

If the Bearcats advance to the second round on Sunday, another two (2) tickets would be given away to the UC-OSU tilt to a lucky Bearcats fans. Those who have purchased Sunday tickets for Columbus in advance will automatically be entered in both drawings.

 

Winners will be contacted by email next week by the athletics ticket office.

"Scholarship Opportunities","UC Student, 

Would a 100% paid college scholarship help with the burden of the cost of college?  

My name is Joseph Popham and I am a career counselor for the Ohio Army National Guard. I would like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you how one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer can help you achieve your goals.

Since you are already a college student you understand the true expenses of a college education. The Ohio Army National Guard has a Scholarship Program that will eliminate the burden of college tuition. This program pays 100% tuition to any public college or university within the state. This would mean that you could attend UC and not have to pay tuition. 

While attending college you will also be paid the Montgomery GI Bill. This is $384.00 (tax free) each month that you are enrolled in college. You would also earn a check for your one weekend a month training starting at $200 for the 2 days. That is over $500 a month while your tuition is being paid! 

If you already have a lot of student loans withdrawn, the Army National Guard also has the Student Loan Repayment Program. If you qualify, this program can repay up to $50,000.00 of your current, qualifying student loans. You could also be eligible for promotion depending on how many college credits you have earned.

There are several other benefits to consider: 

* $400,000 low cost life insurance

* Low-cost health insurance program for as little as $50.00 per month 

* Retire with 20 years of service

* Pride of serving your community, state, and country

* Pride of knowing you make a difference in other people's lives 

If any of this interests you please do not hesitate to contact me in any way. Please contact me at joseph.a.popham.mil@mail.mil

Respectfully,

Joseph Popham

Can you please issue reminders to your students and encourage them all to register? 

 

With the new 1819 Innovation Hub and the President’s Next Lives Here focus, there is unprecedented opportunity for our innovative UC students. We’re using this entry level event to help them get started or move forward in their entrepreneurial journey. 

 

In addition to the cash prizes we’ll be handing out at the event, students will receive valuable feedback from successful entrepreneurs and investors. 1819 will be onsite looking for promising ideas for their new Venture Labs accelerator program. 

 

Students will have the chance to give a 60 second pitch to a small audience (just one judge at a time), which makes this event easy and accessible to all students who have innovative ideas.

 

We hope to see you and many of your students at IQ E-Pitch <http://www.iqepitch.com/>  this year! We’re here to support you and them!

Hello Bearcats! 

Voting for the student government elections has begun! 

For those unfamiliar with student government, they serve as the student’s voice to school administration and those outside of UC. They work to start initiatives and represent the student body in many areas. Examples of what student government has done include working to expand mental health services, fund free flu shots to students, advocate for student interests at the Statehouse, and more. 

Make sure your vote for your representatives for the next year. To vote go to the link on Canopy and choose who you want to have elected to the 8 At-Large Senate positions and Student Body President/ Vice President positions for this upcoming year! 

Voting ends on Friday at noon and all candidate platforms can be found on the student government campus link page under documents, and a social media directory for all candidates can be found below. 

Sincerely,

The Election Facilitation Committee 

Go Vote! <http://canopy.uc.edu>

For a little more background information on our group:

 



 Organization Overview

 

 Our History:

The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 

The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

 

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

 

 Our Mission:

The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus 
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations

 

 

The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program.

We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

April 1st Crossroad Internship Application



The next application cycle for interns who will join the program in May 2019 will begin on March 11. Applications will be open online until April 1 at 11:59 PM. Interviews will be held on Saturday, April 20. 

 

The Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program is targeted toward pre-medical and pre-health students who are interested in gaining real, hands-on experience at a primary care clinic in a low-income community. This includes a balance of clinical tasks which provide interns with invaluable experiences and non-clinical tasks that improve the standard of care at Crossroad. 

 

This is a wonderful opportunity but also a large commitment of time and energy, which is important to keep in mind when applying. Volunteer interns are required to commit to a four hour shift per week over the course of one year.

Please visit the website for details regarding the application process and the Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program; copy/paste this link in a browser: http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html

 

To read about the experiences of students in this program, please visit our blog; copy/paste this link in a browser crossroadhc.blogspot.com <http://crossroadhc.blogspot.com/>

"[CEAS-UG] UC Makers Club Meeting 3/13/19","Hello CEAS!


The UC Makers Club will be holding a meeting this Wednesday, 03/13/19


The UC Makers Club, a new student organization this year, serves as an interactive learning space for students interested in developing creative design skills and hands on engineering experience. This club unifies multidisciplinary groups of students interested in invention and valuable skill building. We aim to foster a community of makers on campus and get students connected to the many resources on campus and at the 1819 innovation hub.


For this meeting, one of our members will be giving a presentation on his woodworking projects and skills – what he’s done, how he’s done it, and resources for beginners to use.


The meeting will be held in the Rec-Center room 3230 from 5:00 – 6:00pm

 

Stop by if you’re interested in getting involved, to hear what the club is about, and to learn about how to get started with woodworking!

Dear Student Leaders,
 
With UC’s Next Lives Here initiative in full swing, we are working to promote this year’s IQ E-Pitch event.

I am in Women in Leadership & Learning which is an organization ran through UC's Women's Center. We talk/learn about Intersectional Feminism, Social Justice, and Activism.

We have to do a Community Action Project that focuses on the 3 pillars of WILL: Action, Justice, and Connection. My group came up with an amazing event that we are calling Self-Love Showcase! We need people to contribute any form of art to present/perform at the event that represents what Self-Love is to them! It can be anything ranging from a dance performance to photography to stand-up comedy to a clay sculpture. This is an event open to ALL UC students, faculty, and staff - we really want it to be a UC community event!

Subject: [UCMC] Upcoming Trips and Meeting Summary 
 

If you didn't make it to the meeting last night you missed our gear auction we hold every semester!  We sold some stuff from the cave and some other people sold some of their own gear as well! People were getting tents for under $100 which is a pretty good deal if you ask me.



We also have some trips coming up:

Gabriel's Place Volunteering - February - April. This is a volunteering place that Sophie Privitera has put us in contact with. Email her at (privitsf@mail.uc.edu) for more information.


Clifton Cleanup - Sun March 10th - (10-12pm) - Katrina, David Daeschner, Tyler Durr


Rockquest Overnight - Sometime in February/March. It is still being planned so that is why the date is still not known. Cost is $25. We will show up to Rockquest and climb for a while and sleep overnight in the climbing area. Lot of fun, we did this last year.

April 5th - 7th - Red River Gorge Backpacking - Katrina Zielonka, Austin Vesely

Lookout Mountain Hang Gliding - April 5th - 7th. Come to Tennessee with us to go hangliding! We have not done this trip for a couple years but we are bringing back this year.



April 13th - Winton Woods Kayak Cleanup - Ben Shaw & Anna Donnel

Spring Break Trips!! March 16th - 23rd
Signups are now closed for all the trips and cannot sign up for them anymore. However people can still lead more trips for others to go on!

Canyoneering in Eardley Canyon, Utah - led by Matthew Maertz. Spend 4 days repelling into slot canyons and backpacking our of Eardley Canyon located in central Utah. Cost is $130

Zion NP, Capitol Reef NP and Arches NP - led by Eli Sorna and Tina McGovern taking 10 people. These are some beautiful national parks to be backpacking through. Cost is $110 


Superstition Wilderness Backpacking and Mountaineering in Arizona and Colorado - led by Ben Shaw and Dalton Spurlin. Backpack through the desolate Arizona desert, play in Great Sand Dunes National Park and climb a mighty 14er. Cost is $100

"[CEAS-UG] Join Engineering Diplomats!  The Application is due next Friday!","Hey CEAS,

Do you remember last week when there was free Chinese food at the Baldwin Tables?  That was Engineering Diplomats!

Don't forget that our application to become a peer mentor or committee member for the 2019-20 academic year is DUE MARCH 15TH - that's next Friday!

Committee Member & Peer Mentor Application: https://goo.gl/forms/5VbjRcXnmhZuvEg73 <https://goo.gl/forms/5VbjRcXnmhZuvEg73> 


Also see attached and below on more information about Engineering Diplomats and the different responsibilities each position can entail.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a little more background information on our group:



 Organization Overview

 Our History:
The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 
The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

 Our Mission:
The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus 
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations



The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program.
We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

All,

 

Good afternoon – please see this exciting project that the DAAP Tribunal currently has a committee dedicated to! They have created an exciting Co-op housing website: www.ucdaaptribunal.wixsite.com/daap <http://www.ucdaaptribunal.wixsite.com/daap>  

And obviously the more data that is collected from students the more fully this site can be built out and that’s where you come in.

 

Please send this survey link to your students: https://goo.gl/forms/ESwBMNh5KUMc1UHP2 <https://goo.gl/forms/ESwBMNh5KUMc1UHP2> 

And encourage them to participate in the housing survey. The survey asks students questions regarding all previous co-op experiences (so all levels can participate). The survey and website address, housing, entertainment, food, and transportation.

 

Your help is GREATLY APPRECIATED as this benefits ALL

Thanks,

Cindy

"[CEAS-UG] Free PIZZA! - Engineering Diplomats Info Session is TODAY AT 5PM!","Hey everyone!

Come learn about the JCI Program and Engineering Diplomats, we will be holding an Info Session TODAY to learn how to get more involved within the Engineering Diplomats from 5-6pm in Swift 616!   And there will be FREE PIZZA!











Have you heard about Engineering Diplomats before? 






 Organization Overview

 Our History:
The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 
The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

 Our Mission:
The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus 
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations



The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program.
We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

"[CEAS-UG] Cultural Food Event - TODAY! hosted by Engineering Diplomats","Hey everyone!


The Engineering Diplomats will be hosting a Cultural Food event TODAY in the Baldwin Lobby from 11:30AM until food runs out!


Come learn about the JCI program and about the engineering diplomats! 
There will be also an Info Session TODAY to learn how to get more involved within the Engineering Diplomats from 5-6pm in Swift 616!





Have you heard about Engineering Diplomats before? 






 Organization Overview

 Our History:
The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 
The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

 Our Mission:
The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus 
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations



The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program.
We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

"[CEAS-UG] Cultural Food Event - TOMORROW! hosted by Engineering Diplomats","Hey everyone!


The Engineering Diplomats will be hosting a Cultural Food event TOMORROW in the Baldwin Lobby from 11:30AM until food runs out!


Come learn about the JCI program and about the engineering diplomats! 
There will be also an Info Session TOMORROW to learn how to get more involved within the Engineering Diplomats from 5-6pm in Swift 616!





Have you heard about Engineering Diplomats before? 






 Organization Overview

 Our History:
The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 
The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

 Our Mission:
The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus 
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations



The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program.
We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

Subject: [UC-IT-MANAGERS] AnyConnect VPN Update #2

 

IT@UC is pleased to announce a new solution for VPN debuting today. Cisco AnyConnect will replace the Pulse Secure client and the web-based SSL VPN as the university's VPN connection to UC's network from off-campus. AnyConnect brings the latest VPN technologies as well as an easier client installation process.

 

As with Pulse Secure, the AnyConnect VPN can be accessed either via the web or through a client application installed on a computer. 

 

Visit vpn.uc.edu <https://vpn.uc.edu/>  to access:

*	The web-based version of AnyConnect.
*	The AnyConnect client application installers. (Please note: You can download and install the  AnyConnect client applications on your device(s) from on or off-campus. Access to UC’s Network via the AnyConnect VPN is available off-campus only.)
*	Link <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/VPN-InstallandUse.aspx>  to AnyConnect download and installation instructions in IT@UC Knowledge Base. 

 

 

Friday, March 1, 2019 is the day! The AnyConnect solution will become the official VPN solution for the university on Friday, March 1, 2019. Pulse Secure will no longer be available, and the sslvpn.uc.edu will redirect to vpn.uc.edu on Friday, March 1, 2019.

 

We encourage all students, faculty and staff who use VPN to make the switch to the new AnyConnect VPN prior to Friday, March 1, 2019, to take advantage of its new features and to avoid any disruption in service.

 

Please feel free to share this information with students, faculty and staff in your areas.

 

Thank you!

What’s New?



Who We Are

The Over-the-Rhine Museum hopes to open a permanent home in 2020. Our dream is that this will be a residential building in which each apartment can be interpreted to a different era in the history of Over-the-Rhine. Visitors might step back in time by entering apartments from the 1890s, 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. They will experience firsthand the crowded conditions, household technologies, and everyday objects of Over-the-Rhine’s past. Our success will depend on our ability to stay open to change and innovation and to react to the changing needs of the neighborhood. We look forward to connecting and collaborating with partner organizations and institutions.

 

What We Do

The Museum’s mission is to bring the history of Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood to life by discovering, interpreting, and presenting the stories of Over-the-Rhine’s residents and urban environment, through an immersive experience with the community’s past.

RISE UC Chapter is hosting a social justice awareness event called A Closer Look at Social Justice featuring many other UC organizations on Friday, February 22 from 5-7 pm in TUC Great Hall.

The purpose of this event is to have a creative platform to spread knowledge on various social justice issues and provide information about resources and organization on and off campus. We think that students should be aware of acid violence along with all other social justice issues. To solve these problems, we must take a closer look and become aware of these problems. With this event, we hope to instigate an action from our students, staff, and faculty members of the University in return or to simply have them be better informed. In this case, that action could be spreading the word of a cause that brought about inspiration or even joining the organization.

There will be free food, informational tabling, videos, speakers, and games with prizes! And there will also be THREE surprise musical performances throughout the event! See the attached flyer for more details.

???    Flint, Michigan Water Drive

 

Due to the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the Alpha Alpha Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has decided to hold a semester long water collection drive. With the help of the UC community, we hope to make a significant impact on the lives of those who have been suffering for years as a result of a state government that has failed them. Something as simple as fixing a glass of clean water to drink has turned into a luxury for those living in the Flint area, and we must continue doing our part to help. All it takes is one small donation at a time to make a difference and spark a change in the country we live in; and we invite you to join us in making that difference!

 

How can I get involved?

We are accepting physical cases of water from any person and/or organization on the campus of the University of Cincinnati or surrounding community. Monetary donations will also be accepted, and we will purchase the case(s) of water on your/your organization’s behalf.

 

How long is this drive going to last?

February 10th – May 1st 2019

 

Where can I drop off my donation?

2543 Fairview Avenue (less than a minute from campus)

Any monetary donations to be made via CashApp. ($1920AA – minimum $5.00 required)

 

Is there any prize/reward?

The person/organization who donates the most cases of water will receive 10 free tickets to our Miss Black and Old Gold Ball as well as an announcement and plaque recognition during our annual Miss Black and Old Gold Scholarship Competition.

 

What if I have questions?

Accepting your invitation to University of Cincinnati's chapter of The National Society of Leadership and Success, Sigma Alpha Pi, takes just a few minutes by visiting www.nsls.org <https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30152098/www.nsls.org?p=eyJzIjoieFotY05PeEExYjRDMEl2NTc4X3BLTGx6ZVlnIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDE1MjA5OCxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5uc2xzLm9yZz91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9aW52aXRlX2RlYWRsaW5lJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pbnZpdGVfZGVhZGxpbmVcIixcImlkXCI6XCJiMzgwMDU4ZTRhNzc0NDZhYWUxOWJhMmY2NTM2OTI5OVwiLFwidXJsX2lkc1wiOltcIjk3YzAxOTFhNmU2Y2IxMTU3ZjM0MzkyM2QyMzg3MzczOTE1Nzg3MTJcIl19In0>  and entering your nomination code, 18570-242-16681.

NSLS membership is a valuable asset to your professional resume and a life changing personal development tool. Sigma Alpha Pi is a leadership honor society (not a fraternity/sorority) available only to select students on campus. Your invitation is a nationally recognized achievement of honorable distinction based on academic accomplishment, leadership potential, or nomination from our campus faculty.

If you missed our most recent Facebook Live event, ""Leadership Live,"" which included a workshop on networking, you can watch it now on our Facebook page. 

Joining Sigma Alpha Pi today places you among the top student leaders on campus and gives you an edge in the employment market through professional leadership training. Results from an independent university study indicate that student GPAs increase after induction into the NSLS. Additionally, NSLS members are nearly four times more likely than other students to land the job of their choice (National survey results compared to 24 percent of college graduates as reported in the New York Times). Membership gives you access to:

- Over a quarter-million dollars in awards and scholarships

- Professional leadership training (a valuable asset to your resume)

- Exclusive events on campus

- Employer recruitment

- Exclusive online job bank

- Networking with other top students on campus

- Discounts that can save you hundreds of dollars on computers, textbooks, car insurance and grad school prep courses

If for some reason you decide not to join, please share with us and the National Office your feedback on our invitation process.

"[CEAS-UG] UC Makers Club Meeting 02/13/19","Hello CEAS!

 

The UC Makers Club will be holding a meeting this Wednesday, 02/13/19

 

The UC Makers Club, a new student organization this year, serves as an interactive learning space for students interested in developing creative design skills and hands on engineering experience. This club unifies multidisciplinary groups of students interested in invention and valuable skill building.

 

For this meeting, we will have a presentation about Arduino, a versatile electronic prototyping platform that can be used for a variety of projects.

 

The meeting will be held in the Rec-Center room 3230 from 5:00 – 6:00 pm.

 

Also, because we are a relatively new club, we will be looking for help in planning and carrying out club operations that can turn into executive roles.

Stop by if you’re interested in getting involved, to hear what the club is about, and to learn about Arduino.

"[CEAS-UG] 2019 Spring Technical Career Fair Week","Hello everyone,

 

I have a ton of information attached below regarding this week’s Technical Career Fair Week, please read through it all! 

 

Technical Career Fair Details/Booklets

As I hope you all know, the Fall Technical Career Fair is Thursday, February 14th from 10AM to 3PM. We will have two locations this Career Fair with Location A being in TUC Great Hall AND Location B being in the Campus Rec Center. We plan to host over 180 companies in both locations; please do your research ahead of time by checking out the online list of attending companies <https://app.joinhandshake.com/career_fairs/6354/employers_list?logged_out_view=student_preview> . You can also research the companies by looking at the attached career fair booklets. Dress code is business professional -- no jeans, t-shirts, tennis shoes, or hoodies will be permitted. Please try to avoid bringing a coat and bookbag, as you are not allowed to bring these items into the fair and Coat/Bag Check can get very busy. Be sure to bring your UC ID and multiple copies of your resume.

 

Information Sessions

Many companies are hosting information sessions this week as well. Please follow the link <https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/careereducation/events/company-information-sessions.html>  for more information.

 

RSVP & Skip the Line!

Are you sick of waiting in long lines to get into the career fair? We are utilizing a new and improved student RSVP system! You will simply stop by our table on the 8th floor of Rhodes (outside the 801 suite) between 9 AM – 5 PM on Wednesday, February 13th, and we will have check-in kiosks ready to print a personalized nametag. If you pick up your nametag on Wednesday, you will not have to wait in line on the day of the fair! Please note, this is not required and you will still be able to get into the career fair using the standard sign-in if you do not RSVP.

If you find yourself unable to find professional clothing due to financial reasons, check out Student Government’s Bearcat Pantry Clothing Closet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_qN_8weesH3SnGeGMeUqpfr6q_NypERv/view?usp=sharing <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_qN_8weesH3SnGeGMeUqpfr6q_NypERv/view?usp=sharing> .

"Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Misconduct","Dear Brayden,
The University of Cincinnati is conducting a campus climate survey to obtain feedback from students about aspects of sexual misconduct. The objective of this survey is to measure awareness of existing programs and to gauge knowledge levels of how to recognize sex discrimination, harassment, and sexual/gender-based violence. This work is important, and we are committed to ensuring a safe, healthy, and nondiscriminatory environment for our students, faculty, and staff.  

Toward this effort, the Office of Institutional Research invites you to participate in the following anonymous survey, which will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Your participation is completely voluntary; there will be no consequences if you choose not to complete the survey. However, your participation would be greatly appreciated and will be helpful to the University as we work to keep our campus free of any and all sexual misconduct. 
 
Response data, without identifiable demographic information, will be shared with the Ohio Department of Education’s Office of Campus Safety & Sexual Violence Prevention.
 
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this survey, please contact Susana Luzuriaga in the Office of Institutional Research at Susana.Luzuriaga@uc.edu <mailto:Susana.Luzuriaga@uc.edu>  or the UC Human Research Protection Program at (513) 558-5259 or irb@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:irb@ucmail.uc.edu> . To report complaints or concerns to an independent agency in an anonymous and confidential manner, please call the Research Compliance Hotline at 1-800-889-1547.
 
The last day to complete the survey is Friday, March 1st, 2019.
 
Many thanks in advance for your participation.

"[CEAS-UG] Email for CEAS Tribunal, regarding volunteers","Hey everyone,

  

It’s that time of the semester, the spring Technical Career Fair is coming up! With that being said, the CEAS tribunal is going to need all the help it can get to make this event a success and we would greatly appreciate YOUR help in making that happen. Below is a link to sign up for hourly time slots the week of the Career Fair (February 12-February 15). 

 

We highly encourage you to volunteer, as is it a great last minute resume booster. But wait there’s more, the volunteers who put in the most hours will be given gift cards (location TBD). If you have any questions or concerns regarding volunteering for the Career Fair, please feel to reach out to me. Below are also answers to a few commonly asked questions.





Link to sign up for Career Fair: https://goo.gl/forms/RFPNwNcZVqwwWAdD2 <https://goo.gl/forms/RFPNwNcZVqwwWAdD2> 





1.      What attire should/can I wear?

Professional dress for Tuesday (2/12), Wednesday (2/13), and Friday (2/15) is not necessary. These days involve purely set up for the Career Fair and tear down after the Career Fair, so come as you are, it's only going to be volunteers present. However, dress for the day of career fair is business professional (no shorts, no jeans, no gym shoes, etc.). This is required for all attendees and volunteers as company representatives will be there.

2.      Does this count for Cincinnatus?

The service hours from this event do not count towards Cincinnatus service hours because it does not qualify based on the standards for the Cincinnatus Scholarship Program.

 

I look forward to seeing you there!

"[SAFETYNOTICE] UC Aware","Feb. 8, 2019

 

Dear UC Community,

 

The UC Public Safety Department has revised our mass notification policy in order to push out a notification as quickly as possible in an emergency situation.

 

When our emergency communications personnel receive credible information that there is a significant emergency or dangerous situation on or very near campus, they will send an alert via text message, email and Bearcat Guardian. The initial alert will be general, and will serve to notify anyone near the affected area that they should be observant and stay where they are if they are in a safe location. For example, it may say, “Police responding to emergency reported on Uptown campus. If safe, stay at your location. Be observant/take action as needed. More info soon.”

 

As soon as our officers have confirmed the details of the situation, a second message will be sent via the same methods with information more specific to the situation. Thereafter, follow up messages will be sent regularly so the campus community stays informed until the incident is resolved.

 

We encourage you to ensure you are signed up to receive alerts. If you are a student, you need to have the “Emergency Text” field in the “Phone Numbers” section under “Personal Information” in Catalyst filled out in order to receive alerts. Please also ensure that the email address, in the “Email Addresses” section, is correct. If you are a faculty or staff member, you must have a cell phone number in the Directory, and you must agree to receive emergency notifications from Public Safety, in order to receive text alerts.

 

We also encourage you to download Bearcat Guardian, our state-of-the-art campus safety app. In addition to receiving emergency alerts through the app, you can also send tips to UCPD, use a safety timer to make sure your friends or co-workers make it to their destination safely, and more. Search “Rave Guardian” in the App Store or Google Play to download. 

 

Sincerely,

James L. Whalen

Director, Public Safety

Congratulations on your recent invitation to join The National Society of Leadership and Success! Just in case you missed your invitation the first time around (the formal invite was sent via US Postal Mail to your home address), I want to make sure you take advantage of this membership opportunity that expires at midnight TONIGHT, 02/08/2019. Accepting your invitation to University of Cincinnati's chapter of The National Society of Leadership and Success, Sigma Alpha Pi, takes just a few minutes by visiting www.nsls.org <https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30152098/www.nsls.org?p=eyJzIjoid21hZFZoU210aFl0RmU5S2tGTnRNTlBSOTFNIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDE1MjA5OCxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5uc2xzLm9yZz91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9aW52aXRlX2RlYWRsaW5lJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1pbnZpdGVfZGVhZGxpbmVcIixcImlkXCI6XCJhZTM3OTNhMzg0OTk0ZTNlYTRkYzUwOWNlMjZlM2NmYlwiLFwidXJsX2lkc1wiOltcIjk3YzAxOTFhNmU2Y2IxMTU3ZjM0MzkyM2QyMzg3MzczOTE1Nzg3MTJcIl19In0>  and entering your nomination code, 18570-242-16681.

NSLS membership is a valuable asset to your professional resume and a life changing personal development tool. Sigma Alpha Pi is a leadership honor society (not a fraternity/sorority) available only to select students on campus. Your invitation is a nationally recognized achievement of honorable distinction based on academic accomplishment, leadership potential, or nomination from our campus faculty.

If you missed our most recent Facebook Live event, ""Leadership Live,"" which included a workshop on networking, you can watch it now on our Facebook page. 

Joining Sigma Alpha Pi today places you among the top student leaders on campus and gives you an edge in the employment market through professional leadership training. Results from an independent university study indicate that student GPAs increase after induction into the NSLS. Additionally, NSLS members are nearly four times more likely than other students to land the job of their choice (National survey results compared to 24 percent of college graduates as reported in the New York Times). Membership gives you access to:

- Over a quarter-million dollars in awards and scholarships

- Professional leadership training (a valuable asset to your resume)

- Exclusive events on campus

- Employer recruitment

- Exclusive online job bank

- Networking with other top students on campus

- Discounts that can save you hundreds of dollars on computers, textbooks, car insurance and grad school prep courses

If for some reason you decide not to join, please share with us and the National Office your feedback on our invitation process. Answering our short survey takes less than 3 minutes to complete by clicking here <https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30152098/www.surveymonkey.com?p=eyJzIjoiTWhUNHhmTElvUmlCeDFmRWFuZ21LRUs1M0xzIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDE1MjA5OCxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5zdXJ2ZXltb25rZXkuY29tXFxcL3JcXFwvTlNMU0lOVklURVwiLFwiaWRcIjpcImFlMzc5M2EzODQ5OTRlM2VhNGRjNTA5Y2UyNmUzY2ZiXCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiOTcxOTBmYzBmZGJjOTlkM2RlNWYzYzZiOTBhMGYyZTE1MDcyYzczZFwiXX0ifQ> .

You have been invited to a career fair on Handshake 

Hello Brayden,

Career Fairs are a great way to connect with employers and learn about potential job opportunities. 

________________________________


University of Cincinnati 2019 Spring Career Fair <http://email.mail.joinhandshake.com/c/eJx1j8tuxCAMRb-GLCOeSViwyGiU34gMeBraAUZA-v0lUmdVVfLGR_dY194si7PLEAynTFNOZ864pGJk48ymeV1vmon7tNHpRiSNEJ7jZw7pgOTrAV84uhyHwygAvijnpQTvqPZaI1jLrEamUFE1PM3R2qsSsRK-9Tnd3zsdOyiIZX9AKLWvk1CSiO1sca_5LA6JuENrmDziHtJ3aLhfnbAQPl2piD6csafwwr_QQXxB-Egd166-xZRbeAQHLeQ0FJOrzSXZ-n6zN0R_Ds385_wAtk9qUQ> 

The Spring Career Fair is your opportunity to meet with employers who are eager to fill full-time, co-op, and internship positions with candidates like you. About 170 employers attend the fair each day.

Professional Day (Wednesday) focuses on jobs for students in Business and Arts & Sciences. Technical Day (Thursday) focuses on jobs in Engineering, Applied Sciences and Information Technology (IT). On Friday, recruiters interview their top candidates from the fair.

How to Prepare for the Fair


*	Review the list of companies that will be there (in Handshake).
*	Research employers that interest you.
*	Prepare a brief (30-second) self-introduction (e.g., name, major, year, and one question).
*	Attend Resume Review Days. Look for these in Handshake:

	*	Engineering hosts a resume review day on the Friday before the fair
	*	Business hosts resume reviews (Resumania) on the Tuesday before the fair

*	Drop in to meet with a peer career coach <http://email.mail.joinhandshake.com/c/eJx1kE2OgzAMhU8DO6KE0AALFlQV10D5McVTklQkKdcfMp3ObiRv3mc_69lm6DqtuhKHmrKe1rStWd1QThhpmWjH8dozfhMTFdeioVbiRr48ulU6E1b5AKK9Ldeh5UL0UjSd4rxj7LIwAZzq1lClan1h5TasMT5Dwceins46joMkTcCkU2hpnylUGy7wo3aA_exoGdG7P1JpcBH2rL3UK7p73iO3R4WOrNFuBZ9StHPwaddQ8JuMEZwBmNG9MMKc02e_yFMWDCZ7TkHGvzAHkXh3Jw6n9WN0PuKC7zjlPvig_O5U-DzkfUcZh_883xuYeNI>  to polish your resume, practice your self-introduction, get ideas for questions to ask, and prepare for interviews. Business students can meet with a coach in Lindner Career Services <http://email.mail.joinhandshake.com/c/eJx1j8tuwyAURL8G74p4OIAXLBxF_g0Lw019WwMRj3x_HbVZVprV0RxpJlhj_GYGtILxiQmmBRcjk5RTzZWe5-vE5U0tTF3JyKLDg35lTLtLoe7uG6jPcdjt3Uh5UdNotBNGb5MRWoK6BBWM5yLAcNi9tUclciZiObP1iglqpd1TCP0k3hWA8lGhPNFDpXuLB5FLb3GtuRcPRN5ca5ACwIrpiQ3W1x4oRKhXK0LAHs8WvPAf9C4-HH6mE9dTfYspN7yjdw1zGorNdcslbfV98XfU0Ox_zg_YvWj7> .
	
*	Attend company information sessions. Information sessions let you learn about a company's culture, hiring process, and current hiring priorities from someone who actually works there. Look for information sessions in Handshake within two weeks of the fair.
*	Plan to spend 1-2 hours at the fair.

What to Wear and Bring


*	Wear business professional or nice business casual attire. No student will be admitted wearing jeans, tennis shoes, or t-shirts.
*	Bring your Bearcat Card (student ID).
*	Bring a folder or portfolio with five to fifteen copies of your resume, a note pad and pen.

Subject: IEEE Guest Speaker - Career Advice from Kristen MacCartney 
 

Hello,




Join us for a career search/networking/interviewing advice session with Kristen MacCartney from IEEE next Thursday, February 7th at 5pm in CRC 3250! 




We will have food, fun, prizes, and useful advice for any major (not just EECS)! A flier is attached that lists some more details. We will go over:

 

*         Identifying emerging tech

*         Enhancing your career search  

*         Impressing in an interview (and on the job)

*         Staying relevant with research and self-directed learning strategies

*         Improve sought-after professional skills (competitive intelligence, global networking, leadership)

*         IEEE scholarships, conferences, competitions, and more…

*         Food… fun… prizes… all are welcome! (IEEE is more than EE!)

  

IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional society, with over 400,000 members in 160 countries worldwide.

Presented by Kristen MacCartney, IEEE Senior University Partnership Program Manager. For 13 years, Kristen has been learning from and supporting IEEE Student Branches at a select group of schools throughout the US, and in India and China. She shares tips learned from her network of ""alumni officers"" on how they benefited from IEEE and launched their careers.


Thanks,

"[CEAS-UG] CEAS Dean Search Update","Members of the CEAS Community-

 

The search committee charged with identify appropriate candidates for the Dean’s position has been diligently working through applications since the fall. Since our return in the new year, the committee has focused on identifying applicants for the semi-finalist stage. The process will include video interviews with the semi-finalists to help the committee identify the appropriate finalists to bring on campus. We are targeting and remain on schedule to bring the finalists to campus the last week of March (after Spring Break) and early April. 

 

I want to take this opportunity to recognize all members of the search committee. They have been meeting regularly to evaluate the more than 70 applications to this opening. Throughout the process, their focus remains on identifying the best candidates for CEAS’ future, and their discussions and interactions have been thoughtful, collegial and inspiring. 

 

I will provide an update once we have clarity on the on-campus finalists, with a goal of providing all of you ample opportunity to prepare to engage with those individuals when they visit UC.

NEWS RELEASE

 

Air Force Research Laboratory, partnered with Wright Brothers Institute, announce International “Swarm and Search AI Challenge”

 

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio – The Air Force Research Laboratory and the United Kingdom Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, or DSTL, in collaboration with Wright Brothers Institute and University of Dayton Research Institute, are proud to announce, the “Swarm and Search AI Challenge: 2019 Fire Hack.” The challenge will explore new, efficient and resilient ways to plan complex Unmanned Aerial Systems search and rescue missions. Concurrent challenges in the U.S. and the U.K., will conclude with a final showdown taking place March 29 - 31, 2019.

 

The theme of this challenge revolves around mapping wildfires and assumes that improved mission planning, and the ability to react to dynamic changes, has the potential to minimize damage and save lives. Solutions spawned by the challenge may also apply to defense applications. Teams will work remotely, via a closed, online collaboration platform to explore different fire map scenarios using Air Force-licensed software. All teams will benefit from exposure to new markets and a chance to test their technology against their competition. Once the top 10 teams have been selected, an international showdown will take place March 29 - 31 in order to select the top three teams from the U.S and the U.K. Those teams will be awarded cash prizes and learn about upcoming funding opportunities. The highest scoring solution will be showcased at the 2019 AUVSI Conference and the UK Embassy Showcase in Washington D.C. 

 

AFRL and DSTL are utilizing this innovative approach to find the best Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning algorithms that embody efficiency and resiliency. Both labs benefit by discovering and engaging with new partners.

 

“It is fantastic to be able to work with DSTL on this project,” said Mick Hitchcock, AFRL program manager. “The activity fits right into both countries’ desire to approach research differently, and involves non-traditional, innovative thinkers as partners and most importantly, get results faster. The competition is not between the two countries, but to highlight the ability to rapidly work together on tough problems.”

 

“Swarming UAS is rich with innovation and we are looking to solve perceived problems and invent new ways of controlling swarms of drones,” said Timothy Wright, DSTL’s Aerospace Systems Group Leader. “There are also a number of Science and Technology challenges already commissioned in this area that link closely with the proposed outputs from this challenge.”

 

U.S. registration began Jan. 15, 2019 and runs through Feb. 26, 2019. The online competition concludes March 15, 2019. For more information, visit www.wbi-challenges.com/ssai.

"[CEAS-UG] FW: AnyConnect VPN Update #2","Dear CEAS Students,

 

Please see below for an important message from UCIT regarding an upcoming change in the university’s VPN solution.  If you need assistance with the new VPN client installation, please contact ResNet (https://www.uc.edu/ucit/services/hardware-software/resnet.html).  If you experience any issues with connecting to UC’s network using the new VPN solution, please contact the UCIT Helpdesk at 513-556-HELP (4357).  

 

 

From: UC-IT-MANAGERS List <UC-IT-MANAGERS@listserv.uc.edu> On Behalf Of Baute, Emily (bauteey)
Sent: Monday, February 4, 2019 2:28 PM
To: UC-IT-MANAGERS@LISTSERV.UC.EDU
Subject: [UC-IT-MANAGERS] AnyConnect VPN Update #2

 

IT@UC is pleased to announce a new solution for VPN debuting today. Cisco AnyConnect will replace the Pulse Secure client and the web-based SSL VPN as the university's VPN connection to UC's network from off-campus. AnyConnect brings the latest VPN technologies as well as an easier client installation process.

 

As with Pulse Secure, the AnyConnect VPN can be accessed either via the web or through a client application installed on a computer. 

 

Visit vpn.uc.edu <https://vpn.uc.edu/>  to access:

*	The web-based version of AnyConnect.
*	The AnyConnect client application installers. (Please note: You can download and install the  AnyConnect client applications on your device(s) from on or off-campus. Access to UC’s Network via the AnyConnect VPN is available off-campus only.)
*	Link <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/VPN-InstallandUse.aspx>  to AnyConnect download and installation instructions in IT@UC Knowledge Base. 

 

 

Friday, March 1, 2019 is the day! The AnyConnect solution will become the official VPN solution for the university on Friday, March 1, 2019. Pulse Secure will no longer be available, and the sslvpn.uc.edu will redirect to vpn.uc.edu on Friday, March 1, 2019.

 

We encourage all students, faculty and staff who use VPN to make the switch to the new AnyConnect VPN prior to Friday, March 1, 2019, to take advantage of its new features and to avoid any disruption in service.

 

Please feel free to share this information with students, faculty and staff in your areas.

 

Thank you!

"[CEAS-UG] Engineering Diplomats - COMMITTEE HEAD APPLICATION DEADLINE EXTENDED","Have you heard about Engineering Diplomats before?

Organization Overview

Our History

The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 

The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

Our Mission

The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus
	
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations
	




The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program. We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"[SAFETYNOTICE] UC Aware","Feb. 1, 2019

 

Dear UC Community,

 

Please be aware that UCPD has seen an increase in reports of fraud involving online scams. The scammers typically ask the victim to pay for something with a gift card, sometimes posing as someone with a student loan company or threatening some government action. Scammers may also ask the victim to deposit a check and then send the scammer a portion of the money. After the victim sends money, the check will be determined to be fraudulent.

 

If you receive an email or a telephone call asking you to purchase gift cards or deposit a check, be skeptical. Follow up with the individual in person or verify with the company by using a reputable phone number. You can also ask UCPD to verify it for you. In addition, check the email address. The name may seem normal, but the actual address may misspell the company name or not make sense. 

 

For more information about scams, please read our Online and Phone Scams webpage <https://www.uc.edu/about/publicsafety/services/crime-prevention/online-and-phone-scams.html> , read the Office of Information Security’s Phishing webpage <https://www.uc.edu/infosec/info/PhishingAwareness.html> , or contact UCPD at 513-556-1111.

 

Sincerely,

James L. Whalen

"[SAFETYNOTICE] UC Aware","Jan. 25, 2019

 

Dear UC Community,

 

Please be aware the UC Police are investigating a report of a car stolen from Calhoun Garage, theft from auto in Eden Garage and several reports of vehicles that were rummaged through in Eden, Clifton Court and Woodside Garages. All incidents occurred this afternoon, Friday, Jan. 25, 2019. All of the vehicles were unlocked. The identity of the suspect is unknown.

 

If you have information about these incidents, or you believe you can identify the suspect, please call UCPD at 513-556-1111 immediately. You can also submit tips to UC Police using the Bearcat Guardian app, available for free through your app store. Search “Rave Guardian.”

 

Important safety reminders:



*	Lock your vehicle at all times, even if you’ll just be gone for a minute.
*	Do not leave belongings in your car, especially in view. A messy car is not a deterrent.

Organization Overview

Our History

The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. 

The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI).  

JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. 

In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

Our Mission

The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) students transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus
	
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations
	




The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program. We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

"FERPA and the Student's Records Rights ","FERPA and the Student's Records Rights
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (34 C.F.R. Part 99 - commonly known as FERPA), is the federal law that governs the release of and access to student education records.  FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records.  These rights include:
The right to inspect and review your education records within forty-five (45) days of the day the University receives a request for access.  
Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect.  The University official will make arrangements for access and will notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.  If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.  Copies of any portion of the record will be provided at a cost currently established at ten cents ($0.10) per page, excluding the official transcript of the student's permanent academic record for which the University's transcript policy and fee will apply.
The right to request an amendment of the student's education record if the student believes it is inaccurate or misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA.  
A student who wishes to ask the University to amend a record should submit a written request to the University office responsible for the record, clearly identifying the part of the record the student wants changed and specifying why it should be changed.  That office will notify the student of its decision.  Contact the Office of the Ombuds at 513-556-5956 should you encounter difficulty in obtaining the requested record review.  If the University office decides not to amend the record as requested, the student may request a hearing before the University's Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act Committee.  To request this hearing, contact the Office of the Registrar.
The right to provide written consent before the University discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.
One of the FERPA exceptions permits disclosure without consent to school officials with ""legitimate educational interest.""  A school official is an employee, agent or other person acting on behalf of the University, to include: a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using University employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, or enrollment/degree certification service facilitator); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.  A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the University.

Upon request, the University also may disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
FERPA affords students the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.  The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance Office
U.S. Department of Education
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20202-5920
University Rules <http://www.uc.edu/trustees/rules.html>  10.43.11 and 10.43.13 establish University of Cincinnati procedures for FERPA compliance.
 
Directory Information
At its discretion, University of Cincinnati may provide ""directory information"" in accordance with FERPA provisions.  Directory information is defined as that information which would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.  Designated directory information at University of Cincinnati includes the following:
Category I:    student's name, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees conferred and dates, honors and awards, college, class, and  major field of study
Category II:   student identifier (non-Social Security Number), address, e-mail address, and telephone number
Students may block the public disclosure of directory information (all or by category)
Please consider carefully the consequences of a decision to withhold directory information.  A non-disclosure block will call for University of Cincinnati not to release any or all of your ""directory information"".  Thus, University of Cincinnati will deny any future requests for such information submitted by non-institutional third persons or organizations.  University of Cincinnati will honor your request to withhold directory information but cannot assume responsibility to contact you for subsequent permission to release this information.  Regardless of the effect upon you, the University assumes no liability as a result of honoring your instructions that such information be withheld.  University of Cincinnati will honor requests for the non-disclosure of directory information until the student rescinds the request.

"[UCMC] Upcoming Trips","Hey Everyone! 


If you didn't make it to the meeting last night you missed out on Katrina Zielonka talking about his trip to the Organ Mountains. We have some trips coming up soon that I wanted to tell you all about!




We have a group of people headed to Perfect North for college night on Feb 1st the cost is $25 and Brett Hochman is leading everyone out there. It should be a really fun time with a lot of skiing and snowboarding.




Ben Shaw is leading a day trip to go paintballing on February 9th from 11am to 5pm. The cost is $35 and hopefully wont be too cold.




Ben is also leading another backpacking trip to Red River Gorge on February 15th - 17th. Again cost should just be gas and food.




Of course we also have our very important and even more fun Bockfest Fundraiser on March 2nd! That is always a lot of fun.


We also have another trip Rockquest overnight happening sometime in February/March. It is still being planned so that is why the date is still not known. Cost is ~$25 or $35 I believe. We will show up to Rockquest and climb for a while and sleep overnight in the climbing area. It was a lot of fun when we did that last year.


We have now opened signups for the Spring Break Trips!! All dates for these three trips are March 16-23




First we have trip to 3 national parks out west. Eli Sorna will be leading everyone to Zion NP, Capitol Reef NP and Arches NP. These are some beautiful national parks and it will be mostly backpacking. Cost is ~$110 





Second we have Superstition Wilderness Backpacking and Mountaineering in Arizona and Colorado. This is being led by Ben Shaw and Dalton Spurlin. Cost is ~$100 



Finally we have a Canyoneering trip to Eardley Canyon in Utah. This trip will be led by me Matthew Maertz. Cost is ~$130




The link for the trip signups is http://ucmountaineering.weebly.com/calendar-and-sign-ups.html




And we are also going to be designing a new T-Shirt!! We are asking for design submissions and you are allowed to submit 1 per person. You have until February 11th at 4pm to submit it. Send the submissions to ucmountaineering@gmail.com <mailto:ucmountaineering@gmail.com> . Designs must be appropriate and we will vote on the designs at the meeting on February 13th. 








Sincerely,

UC EARNS HLC REACCREDITATION
Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

I write to share the great news that the University of Cincinnati has earned reaccreditation from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The accreditation process <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001cCkcNg78kr6lrogVZCDfjg1xr3q95v-CLxehwy4CwCXRS38C4lXBIKk5fG7t2LfUfYLrbm2dqJqsFixldSSPN6lBXY6D5UyvB1_QsAF6WfUn7JZaSyKz48kGe25xw2DoJcVihhTGzaSkFJWLfnp1TU8kuwAqqgcOjkK5DOg-ABg=&c=de2H3FeO9EszyeBPN0Ru87wCqBnZOplpxoWdoPv97Mi76C5n-CIIlg==&ch=opXMHtxh1mlVvEsa4ePrZxrBpaaBo2JJqBGU_HHCJTsSue9G26Bsrg==> , pursued every 10 years, provides an important signal to the public that UC is meeting the commission’s standards of excellence for high-quality education and educational experience.

The final report examined five key areas of the university: mission; integrity; teaching and learning quality, resources and support; teaching and learning evaluation and improvement; resources, planning and institutional effectiveness. UC fully met all HLC expectations in each area without the need for follow-up or additional documentation. 

As a part of this process, we engaged in a self-study – examining our institution, celebrating our successes and discovering areas for continued enhancement. Accreditation may sound like a formality, but it demonstrates to peers and stakeholders our deep commitment to educational excellence and continuous improvement.

Many members of our UC community devoted time and talent to this important undertaking. I want to thank and congratulate Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Kristi Nelson for her leadership along with Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies Gigi Escoe for heading the UC team that prepared the extensive documentation needed, coordinating the site visit and serving as our liaison and point of contact with the HLC. 

We also owe our profound gratitude to our reaccreditation core team – including Doug Burgess, Jamie Byrne, Adrian Hall, Provost Fellow Amy Lind, Susana Luzuriaga, April Poteet, Michele Ralston, Bryan Smith and Lauren Thomas – as well as the many faculty and staff who participated in drafting and reviewing the self-study document and the comprehensive final report. Beyond those involved in the process, UC’s outstanding review would not be possible without the passion and commitment to quality that our faculty and staff put into practice every day. 

Please join me in expressing our appreciation to Provost Nelson, Vice Provost Escoe and all of the colleagues across our colleges and units whose work contributed to this successful outcome.

With gratitude,


Neville G. Pinto
President

I hope everyone is having a great start to the Spring semester!




ChemE Car will be having the first official meeting of the semester THIS Wednesday, January 23rd, in 605 ERC at 6pm.




Just a reminder, ChemE Car is open to ALL MAJORS. 





ChemE Car is a competition among universities to build a shoebox-sized car that runs off of a chemical process. There are many aspects other than chemistry that go into the design, building, and testing of this car. That is why students of all majors are valuable to the team.





If you are interested but unable to attend this meeting, please send me an email at bollinmg@mail.uc.edu. Feel free to email me if you have any questions about ChemE Car or if you would like to know more about the group.

Looking for volunteers for Outdoors service projects
 
If you like being outside, nature, and exercise, come help the Western Wildlife Corridor clear invasive plants (honeysuckle) and build trails in our preserves.
 
The Western Wildlife Corridor has a number of significant nature preserves along the Ohio River from Price Hill to Cleves North Bend (West side of Cincinnati).  Clearing invasive plants, restoring the land to native vegetation, and building trails are a major task of our organization.  We do this all year long and greatly welcome any help from organizations that are looking for service projects.  We have a website and a Facebook page.  Our ‘crown jewel’ is the Bender Mountain Preserve near Mt St. Joe’s.  Bender Mountain is considered to be the best place to see native wildflowers in Southwest Ohio.

The Student Impact Symposium is intended to provide a platform for students to exhibit their impact outside of the classroom to an audience made up of potential employers, faculty, peers, family, and alumni. Students will begin the evening with an open display of their projects allowing for demonstration and dialogue between students and the audience about their impact and achieved learning outcomes. Select impact pieces will be handpicked for individual presentations to take place during a reception following the open forum, at which time prizes will be awarded and the event will come to a formal close.

Projects submitted for the Student Impact Symposium must identify with at least one of the office of Student Activities and Leadership Development’s values of diversity, integrity, growth, leadership, and community.

First off we have another trip Rockquest overnight happening sometime in January/February/March. Cost is ~$25 or $35 I believe. We will show up to Rockquest and climb for a while and sleep overnight in the climbing area. It was a lot of fun when we did that last year.




The link for the trip signups is http://ucmountaineering.weebly.com/calendar-and-sign-ups.html




And we are also going to be designing a new T-Shirt!! We are asking for design submissions and you are allowed to submit 1 per person. You have until February 11th at 4pm to submit it. Send the submissions to ucmountaineering@gmail.com. Designs must be appropriate and we will vote on the designs at the meeting on February 13th.

"[CEAS-UG] ""The Hate U Give"" Screening and Discussion","The UC community is invited to a screening of the 2018 movie, The Hate U Give, presented by the COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COLLECTIVE.

 

Movie Night and Community Discussion

January 25th 

6:00 PM - 9:00 PM

People's Liberty

1805 Elm St.

Cincinnati, OH 45202

 

*         Doors open at 5:30pm

*         Free Refreshments and Movie Screening at 6pm

*         Community Discussion Following Movie

*         RSVP at https://thehateugivecec.eventbrite.com <https://thehateugivecec.eventbrite.com> 

 

Movie summary:

Starr Carter is constantly switching between two worlds: the poor, mostly black, neighborhood where she lives and the rich, mostly white, prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Now, facing pressures from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and stand up for what's right. THE HATE U GIVE is based on the critically acclaimed New York Times bestseller by Angie Thomas and stars Amandla Stenberg as Starr, with Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Common, Anthony Mackie and Issa Rae.

If you didn't make it to the meeting last night you missed out on a fun meeting with Corey Liebau talking about his trip to the Organ Mountains. We have some trips coming up soon that I wanted to tell you all about!




We have a group of people headed to Perfect North for college night on Feb 1st the cost is $25 and Brett Hochman is leading everyone out there. It should be a really fun time with a lot of skiing and snowboarding.




Dalton Spurlin has a Cold Weather backpacking trip to the Red River Gorge going out on January 26th and 27th. Cost should just be gas and food.




Ben Shaw is leading a day trip to go paintballing on February 9th from 11am to 5pm. The cost is $35 and hopefully wont be too cold.




Ben is also leading another backpacking trip to Red River Gorge on February 15th - 17th. Again cost should just be gas and food.




Of course we also have our very important and even more fun Bockfest Fundraiser on March 2nd! That is always a lot of fun.




We will be letting you guys know about all of the spring break trips coming up next week so be sure to come to the meeting next week!

"For those who completed Marketing Research Survey","Hi All,

 A big ""thank you!"" to all who participated in the survey regarding ticket redemption. 

Some things that need clarifaction:

1. The situations mentioned in the survey were hypothetical and are not actually being considered by UC Athletics. These considerations were used for educational purposes only. 

2.  If you completed the survey, your five priority points for Ruckus Rewards will be processed within ten business days.

Again, thank you to all who participated in the survey and best of luck this semester!

Go Bearcats!

Looking for volunteers for Outdoors service projects
 
If you like being outside, nature, and exercise, come help the Western Wildlife Corridor clear invasive plants (honeysuckle) and build trails in our preserves.
 
The Western Wildlife Corridor has a number of significant nature preserves along the Ohio River from Price Hill to Cleves North Bend (West side of Cincinnati).  Clearing invasive plants, restoring the land to native vegetation, and building trails are a major task of our organization.  We do this all year long and greatly welcome any help from organizations that are looking for service projects.  We have a website and a Facebook page.  Our ‘crown jewel’ is the Bender Mountain Preserve near Mt St. Joe’s.  Bender Mountain is considered to be the best place to see native wildflowers in Southwest Ohio.

The Student Impact Symposium is intended to provide a platform for students to exhibit their impact outside of the classroom to an audience made up of potential employers, faculty, peers, family, and alumni. Students will begin the evening with an open display of their projects allowing for demonstration and dialogue between students and the audience about their impact and achieved learning outcomes. Select impact pieces will be handpicked for individual presentations to take place during a reception following the open forum, at which time prizes will be awarded and the event will come to a formal close.

Projects submitted for the Student Impact Symposium must identify with at least one of the office of Student Activities and Leadership Development’s values of diversity, integrity, growth, leadership, and community.

"[CEAS-UG] UC Robotics Team General Meeting","Hello everybody,

You are invited to attend the first meeting of the semester for the University of Cincinnati Robotics Team. Being a part of the team is a fantastic chance to get practical, hands-on experience and work on projects beyond what would be covered in the classroom. No experience is required to join. All you need is an interest in any of the many aspects of robotics such as Linux, programming, 3D-printing, and electrical and mechanical design.

The first meeting of the semester will be held Wednesday, January at 7:15 p.m. in Room 544 of Baldwin Hall. The following meetings will be located in 544 Baldwin. During this meeting, we will introduce you to the team’s work as we share the progress made in the fall and discuss the projects for the spring. 

About the Team
The University of Cincinnati Robotics Team is part of the UC Center for Robotics Research. The team works with students to teach them the basics of robotics while providing opportunities to develop their skills with programming and robotic design. The team meets every Wednesday evening at 7:15 in the team lab located at 545 Baldwin. The team’s primary projects this year include:

*	Dokalman MK2 – Dokalman is the team's autonomous navigation robot. The robotics team competes each year in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition against teams from all around the world. This year we will be building an entirely new version of Dokalman. 


If you have any questions or are interested in joining the team but can't attend this week's meeting, several members of the team can be found in the lab all throughout the week working on different projects. You can also email the team at uc.robotics.team@gmail.com <mailto:uc.robotics.team@gmail.com> . 

Please go and join the team via campus link at https://campuslink.uc.edu/organization/university-of-cincinnati-robotics-team <https://campuslink.uc.edu/organization/university-of-cincinnati-robotics-team> .

"[CEAS-UG] Engineering Diplomats Recruitment 2019","Good morning everyone!




My name is Sook Kuan and I am one of the committee heads on behalf of the Communication Team for Engineering Diplomats!

We are recruiting UC students from ANY MAJOR  to join as part of our committee team and peer mentors!




First of all, have you heard about Engineering Diplomats before? Here is the summary of it!




 <https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bfYrbXOunopKqYtEKrBoPPN8f_hUfoieazRUSj5JgeCi0-N2FqD1miInyQeA7yGJtwoy0hqwea_VYQEMQaaeqFNHPopbRyE6c812_Yl3RikMH_A3NOD-5hoabf8ahkqx97ihzEBc> 

Organization Overview

Our History

The Engineering Diplomats was founded on August 19th, 2016 under the direction of the College of Engineering and Applied Science and JCI. The predecessor and original partner to The Engineering Diplomats was the Joint Co-op Institute (JCI). JCI was started in October 2013 and represents a collaboration between the University of Cincinnati’s College of Engineering and Applied Science (UC-CEAS) and Chongqing University (CQU) where the engineering curriculum at UC is exported to CQU. In Fall 2017, enrolled students in the JCI program began transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus to finish their senior year in America, setting up the partnership between JCI and the Engineering Diplomats. 

Our Mission

The Engineering Diplomats is an organization that seeks to:

	
*	Build excitement and understanding for the arrival of Chongqing University (CQU) transferring to the University of Cincinnati’s main campus
	
*	Create community and foster innovation through intercultural relations
	

The arrival of the CQU students marks an opportunity for both UC and CQU students to gain international experience and cultural competency. The Engineering Diplomats host events prior to the CQU students’ arrival to raise awareness for the benefits of the program. We also strive to develop a sustainable support system beyond their arrival at UC through collaboration with existing student organizations and other partnerships.

Our Committee's Roles Summary

Communications : Newsletter, Info Session, Social Media

Event Planning : Festivals, Events Management

Peer Mentorship : Mentors to CQU Students

You can find more information of what we do in the team in the attachments.

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!


New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
After the migration, even if your desktop software is not working yet, you will still be able to access your email via the web using the Outlook Web App.

NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada).

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?


A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/Office365-OutlookSlowness.aspx>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?


If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.

NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

Hello!

 

My name is Charlie MacKenzie and I am the External Vice President of Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations, or SCNO. SCNO is a student run organization that provides pro bono consulting for nonprofits in the Cincinnati area. SCNO provides clients with meaningful strategic consulting to achieve significant results in the community, while simultaneously fostering opportunities for students to develop professional skills and gain practical consulting experience. A majority of our consultants are business majors, and although consulting tends to stem from business professions, we would love to bring a more diverse range of perspectives into SCNO through students in different majors across a variety of colleges.

 

Applications for SCNO are currently on our website, https://ucscno.weebly.com/ , under the “Application” tab and close at 11:59pm on January 16th. Our executive team would greatly appreciate it if you could forward this information about SCNO and the application to the students you advise so we can attract a broad range of applicants from different colleges.

 

Thank you,

Charlie MacKenzie

Close your email client (e.g. Outlook & Mail).

For the best experience and least disruption during your email migration, we recommend that you shut down your email software before the end of each business day–or before you leave campus for the day–during your scheduled migration week.

Pass the news.

Please pass the word on to others who will be affected by the email migration. Download flyers or post digital screens in your divisions.

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!


New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
After the migration, even if your desktop software is not working yet, you will still be able to access your email via the web using the Outlook Web App.

NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada).

Visit the new Outlook Web App >> <https://mail.uc.edu>

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?


A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/Office365-OutlookSlowness.aspx>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?


If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.

NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

View more info on the website about dual accounts >> <https://www.uc.edu/ucit/maintenance/office365/what-to-expect1.html>

Close your email client (e.g. Outlook & Mail).

For the best experience and least disruption during your email migration, we recommend that you shut down your email software before the end of each business day–or before you leave campus for the day–during your scheduled migration week.

Please pass the word on to others who will be affected by the email migration. Download flyers or post digital screens in your divisions.

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!


New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
After the migration, even if your desktop software is not working yet, you will still be able to access your email via the web using the Outlook Web App.

NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada).

Visit the new Outlook Web App >> <https://mail.uc.edu>

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?


A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/Office365-OutlookSlowness.aspx>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?


If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.

NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

Close your email client (e.g. Outlook & Mail).

For the best experience and least disruption during your email migration, we recommend that you shut down your email software before the end of each business day–or before you leave campus for the day–during your scheduled migration week.

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!


New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
After the migration, even if your desktop software is not working yet, you will still be able to access your email via the web using the Outlook Web App.

NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada).

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?


A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/Office365-OutlookSlowness.aspx>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?


If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.

NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

SPECIAL COMMISSION TO STUDY MCMICKEN
Dear UC Community,

We write to inform you that we are establishing a special university-wide commission to examine the life and legacy of Charles McMicken and the use of his name at the University of Cincinnati. The commission will devote the upcoming semester to studying this issue and engaging with the community, culminating in the submission of a formal report to the President for consideration.

Representing a broad cross-section of university constituents, the commission will be co-chaired by Lou Bilionis and Janet Reid. Professor Bilionis, dean emeritus of the College of Law, is a highly accomplished scholar, teacher and administrator. In addition to co-chairing the university’s Diversity Council for many years, Professor Bilionis has led several cross-college committees throughout his career. Dr. Reid is a nationally recognized and respected expert on equity and inclusion. She has worked with dozens of colleges and universities, in addition to having served as a trustee for The Ohio State University and Xavier University. We want to extend our admiration and appreciation to them for co-leading this critical endeavor.    

Several institutions across the country have been called on to examine symbols and names associated with racism and exclusion. Multiple cities have removed or relocated statues memorializing Confederate figures, while numerous sports teams have changed mascots to eliminate racial and ethnic appropriation. On the other hand, some institutions have left contested markers in place as visible reminders of our nation’s history and its shortcomings related to justice, equity, inclusion and representation. 

At UC, we have an enduring responsibility, both intellectually and morally driven, to ground the study of complex issues in our academic values of inquiry, discovery, analysis, dialogue and sound decision making. The question of McMicken’s ongoing affiliation with our campus is one such topic. More than our attention, it deserves our academic rigor as we seek to define a clear path forward. 

At this point, we know that McMicken was a slave-owner and businessman whose will in 1858 bequeathed nearly $1 million to the City of Cincinnati to found a university. McMicken wanted the institution to educate, in his words, “white boys and girls.” How we figure these troubling facts into our current identity and future direction is now ours to determine. 

From the outset, we realize that thoughtful minds may interpret the same evidence and arrive at different conclusions. We also know that our respective view of history and its conceptual underpinnings will shape our perspective. For instance, some of us may view historical representation as largely fixed in the past. Others of us may view it as more open and malleable in the present. Both approaches speak to the reality that how we start this line of inquiry influences where we end. Nevertheless, at every step, we must rely on our bedrock principles of respect, empathy, civility and collegiality to guide our way.

Challenging conversations have the potential to divide us. But our shared commitment to this great institution, despite its imperfect history, must keep us united and undeterred in our efforts to advance knowledge, change lives and build community. We owe it to everyone involved—past, present and future—to listen first, learn always and act wisely.     
          
Thank you for your interest and engagement.

Sincerely,



Neville Pinto                                      
President

Dear Brayden,
Student tickets for the UCLA game will be available starting Thursday, December 13th at 8am! While supplies last, tickets will be available for all full-time students regardless of their rUCkus Rewards priority status. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis.

For your convenience, we strongly recommend claiming your ticket online for this round of redemption. Please sign into your account prior to Thursday to make sure you are able to access the student portal. If you experience any issues, please call 1-877-CATS-TIX before Thursday's ticket claim. 

Students will receive a free Under Armour t-shirt at the game by presenting their rUCkus Student Section ticket! We are encouraging everyone to wear black.

*Please be aware that your priority point status may change before next week's UCLA ticket claim due to the priority point opportunity at tonight's women's basketball game against VCU.

Close your email client (e.g. Outlook & Mail).


For the best experience and least disruption during your email migration, we recommend that you shut down your email software before the end of each business day–or before you leave campus for the day–during your scheduled migration week.

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!



New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
After the migration, even if your desktop software is not working yet, you will still be able to access your email via the web using the Outlook Web App.


NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada).

Visit the new Outlook Web App >> <https://www.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb&id=5a2ed3e2e8&e=08daa0c2b5>

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?



A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://www.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb&id=80520c7a3a&e=08daa0c2b5>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?



If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.


NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

View more info on the website about dual accounts >> <https://www.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb&id=3819d85afc&e=08daa0c2b5>

Dear UC Community,

On Dec. 5, in addition to regular testing of our voice alert system, we will be performing additional tests of the system. The additional tests will be performed on the Uptown West and Medical campuses.

In addition, on Dec. <x-apple-data-detectors://0>  26-28 and Jan. 2-4, the Public Safety Department will conduct various tests of the campus alert system throughout the day. During these tests you may hear various voice announcements over the voice announcement component of the fire alarm system. If your building fire alarm system activates, please be sure to evacuate the building. These tests will occur on all campuses.

Sincerely,

On Thursday, December 6th, from 3:30 to 5:00pm in E-351 at CARE Crawley the Minority Association of Pre-Medical Students (MAPS) is hosting a study table session for medical students at the University of Cincinnati.

This is not a tutoring session but more so an opportunity to meet, advise, and encourage underrepresented minority students who are interested in the field of medicine. Feel free to bring your study notes and of course your love for medicine! Some students may also bring a personal statement to look over or may want to discuss what classes they should consider or what summer opportunities they should be taking advantage of to be more competitive for medical school! It is a great ending for our phenomenal semester. . Do not feel obligated to stay for the entire time if you don't have the time to do so.

Free donuts will be provided to snack on while you study! Please contact either Bryana Robinson (robin2bm@mail.uc.edu) or Cincinnati MAPS (Cincinnatimaps@snma.org).

"[COOP-STUDENTS] Exploring Culture, Life, and Work Abroad This Spring - PD2010","Greetings,

 

Interested in working abroad but not sure where to start? Want to learn more about what it takes to find an international co-op or internship? There’s a course for that. PD2010 - Exploring Culture, Life, and Work Abroad is a new course designed to introduce students to concepts and practices necessary to successfully live and work abroad and provide an overview of international program options at the university. The course will allow you to explore your own Cultural Intelligence and develop a personalized plan for improvement while exploring the traits of a culture of your choice. This course is open to students in all majors, provides DC/SE BOK credit, and can be used as a substitute for the Introduction to International Co-op course, for students interested in the International Co-op Program!

 

Have questions? Please feel free to reply to this email, and I’ll be happy to assist. See the attached flyer for additional details.

"[Instr Note] Removal","Instructor Patrick Olekas posted a new Note. Your instructor selected to notify everyone in real time of this post, bypassing user email preferences.

Removal



I didn't discuss this in class.

But the Removal portion is not a simple as simply removing the item from the list.

Imagine we stored 4 items that have the same hash in a 4 item hashTable.

X

Y

Z

A

And we want to remove Y.   So we yank it out of the table.  THis means lookup of Z and A will fail as we will stop at index Y was at.

http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/online/blackboard/chapter/05/documents/contribute/chapter/05/linear-probing.html

This page above discuss a solution.   That is we would have something like this:

class Node

{

// Class with key and data value and accessors, and mutators.

}

class HashNode

{

   HashNode()

{

  nodeData = nullptr;

  wasDeleted = false;

}

// And add in some accessors and mutators for the data below

   Node * nodeData;

   bool wasDeleted;

}

but since I didn't discuss this  in class you DO NOT have to handle the delete case.   I do like this being a good final question though :)

Does the Hash Table have to be able to resize if it becomes full 11/29/18 1:34 PM



Does our hash table need to be able to resize itself if it becomes too full?

I think the current hash function would prevent this from being possible because the function depends on the maximum size of the table.  Resizing would cause the hash function to change which would mess up the location of all the elements

"Re: [CEAS-UG] IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh - OLD CHEM, RHODES, BALDWIN","Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

Here is some important information regarding the UC_Secure wireless upgrade:

There have been reports received of trouble accessing UC_Secure on Windows 7 computers after the Wireless Refresh, and not being prompted to accept the new certificate as described in the email below.  We have been provided two suggestions to fix this.  The first is to “Forget” the UC_Secure wireless network and the reconnect to it.  If that does not work, please visit the IT@UC Knowledge Base article “UC_Secure Windows 7 Reconfiguration Instructions” for another more detailed work-around.  The link to the article is:  https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/UC_Secure-Win7reconfig.aspx <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/UC_Secure-Win7reconfig.aspx>  

 

Other articles that may be useful during this upgrade:

Manual UC_Secure Setup for Windows 7:  https://kb.uc.edu/kbarticles/UC_Secure-Windows7.aspx

Setup articles for other operating systems:  https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/GO.aspx

 

Thank you for your patience during this transition time.

Subject: IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh - OLD CHEM, RHODES, BALDWIN

 

Dear Faculty, Staff and Students, 

This is a notification to provide information regarding the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project.  Phase 2, the Wireless Network Refresh in Old CHEMistry building, rhodes Hall and BALDWIN HALL is scheduled for this week and next week.

                OLD CHEM is to be completed Tuesday, Nov. 27 & Wednesday, Nov. 28.

rhodes Hall and BALDWIN HALL are to be completed Thursday, Nov. 29; Friday, Nov. 30;  Monday, Dec. 3;  Tuesday, Dec. 4; & Wednesday, Dec. 5.


What you need to know.


There is expected to be no disruption of wireless service during the upgrade.


UCIT technicians will be replacing one Wireless Access Point (WAP) at a time.  These replacements will take place during regular business hours.  Devices connected to a WAP while it is being replaced, will automatically roam to the next closest WAP.  This changeover should seem unnoticed.

 


Accept the “netauth.uc.edu” authentication certificate on your wireless devices as early as Monday, Nov. 26 for Old Chem, and Wednesday, Nov. 28 for Rhodes/Baldwin.


After the upgrade has started, faculty, staff and students in these buildings may be prompted to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each wireless device they use to connect to UC_Secure. 

UC_Secure will require you to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each of your wireless devices only once. 

 


Techs will be in these buildings from 7 A.M. to 4 P.M., on the days of the upgrades.


UCIT Technicians and Contractors will replace wireless access points in offices, classrooms, hallways and study areas throughout these buildings from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., each day during the Wired Network Refresh. Wired and wireless network service (including UC_Secure and UC_Guest) will be available throughout the IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh Project.  

 


How to get help.


Please report any wireless network issues to either Megan Pfaltzgraff at 556-1243 or email pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu>  or Jim Jordan at 556-1985 or email jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu> .  We will notify UCIT technicians to resolve any issues.

 

You may visit the project website <http://www.uc.edu/ucit/maintenance/it-network-phone-refresh>  for more information about the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project. 

Thank you for your support of this priority project to provide the university a smarter, faster, and more secure network.

Post-Migration Information

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!



New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
https://mail.uc.edu <https://mail.uc.edu/> 
After the migration, you will still be able to access your email online via the Outlook Web App, even if your desktop client is not working yet.


NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada.

Visit the new Outlook Web App >> <https://www.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb&id=44f6eabd86&e=e4bf9f57c6>

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?



A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://www.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb&id=207fc438b1&e=e4bf9f57c6>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?



If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.


NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

View more info on the website about dual accounts >> <https://www.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb&id=f4b6a6fe46&e=e4bf9f57c6>

"College Money and Career Opportunities with the Army and Army Reserve ","Hello Brayden, 

 

               

               My name is SFC Emmerich with the U.S. Army and Army Reserves as your local U.S. Army representative, I would like to tell you about the many opportunities the Army has to offer. Whether your focus is attending college or joining the workforce, the Army has more than 150 career fields and numerous financial programs to help you make the most of your life.

 

               Qualified Active Duty applicants can earn up to and over $100,000 for continuing education through the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, may qualify for a signing bonus of up to $25,000, and receive tuition assistance to pay for college while serving on Active Duty.

 

               Qualified Reserves applicants can earn up to $46,000 for continuing education through the Reserves Montgomery G.I. Bill, up to $50,000 to repay student loans, tuition assistance to help pay for college while serving, and may qualify for a signing bonus of up to $20,000. The Reserves are part time requiring you too do training one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer. You can still work and go to school full time.  You can even be stationed with a Reserve unit in the Cincinnati Area, making it easy to work, go to school and attend your training.

 

               Of course, the benefits of joining the U.S. Army go beyond just the monetary. In addition to becoming a stronger individual as you gain new training, you’ll also feel a sense of accomplishment, experience true camaraderie, and develop leadership skills employers’ value.

"[UCMC] Eagle Watch Weekend","Hi all

Back in 2012, my wife and I went Lake Barkley State Park for an eagle watch weekend (you can see photos on my Facebook page “2012 Land Between The Lakes” album). I think this would be a good trip for the club.

More info below.

Eagle Watch Weekends Available At Kentucky State Parks

Trips Available In January, February

FRANKFORT, Ky. (Nov. 27, 2018) – A unique tradition for more than 40 years, Kentucky State Parks announced dates for its 2019 Eagle Watch Weekends, a chance to observe bald eagles as they gather around the major lakes of western Kentucky looking for food.

This unique wildlife-watching opportunity is offered as a tour by water in January and February of 2019 at three Kentucky state resort parks.

Led by state park naturalists and staff from the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, the tours also offer a chance to learn about other wildlife in the area.

Each state resort park – Kentucky Dam Village, Lake Barkley, and Kenlake – will offer morning and afternoon yacht tours. A brunch cruise will be a featured event unique to Kenlake, while Kentucky Dam Village will also offer van tours to the Ballard Wildlife Management Area.

The dates for Eagle Watch Weekends are listed below, along with each park and its phone number:

Jan. 11-13: Kentucky Dam Village State Resort Park - (270) 362-4271

Jan. 25-27: Lake Barkley State Resort Park - (270) 924-1131

Feb. 1-3: Kenlake State Resort Park - (270) 474-2211

Most tours last between 3-3.5 hours. Ticket prices are $56 per person, and all three parks will offer overnight packages. Evening programs will be provided on Fridays and Saturdays. The Kenlake brunch cruise is set for Feb. 3.

School groups interested in taking an educational cruise on Feb. 1 from Kenlake State Resort Park should contact Carey Ruff at carey.ruff@ky.gov or call 502-892-3355.

The yacht tours are conducted from the CQ Princess, a 96-foot, fully enclosed yacht that allows viewing from inside a heated cabin or outside.

Guests are encouraged to bring warm clothes, rain gear and binoculars. These tours may take place under extreme weather conditions. Each resort offers lodges, cottages and restaurants. Registration is required for the Eagle Watch Weekends. Call the individual park for registration, lodging details and ticket information. For more about Kentucky State Parks, visit: www.parks.ky.gov <http://www.parks.ky.gov/>

"problem reading in file","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

problem reading in file



i cannot seem to get the file to read in correctly. i feel like i must have made a syntax error or something but all of the examples i've found online are not helping. 

When i walk through the debugger, i can see that the string, matrixline, is simply being changed to """", as opposed to the test.txt file (which is a 4x4 matrix of 0's and 1's, separated by ;'s). 

for the record, i have the test.txt file saved in the same folder as the header file. the entire rest of the lab (all other unit tests and exe file functions) work.

"[CEAS-UG] IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh - OLD CHEM, RHODES, BALDWIN","Dear Faculty, Staff and Students, 

This is a notification to provide information regarding the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project.  Phase 2, the Wireless Network Refresh in Old CHEMistry building, rhodes Hall and BALDWIN HALL is scheduled for this week and next week.

                OLD CHEM is to be completed Tuesday, Nov. 27 & Wednesday, Nov. 28.

rhodes Hall and BALDWIN HALL are to be completed Thursday, Nov. 29; Friday, Nov. 30;  Monday, Dec. 3;  Tuesday, Dec. 4; & Wednesday, Dec. 5.


What you need to know.


There is expected to be no disruption of wireless service during the upgrade.


UCIT technicians will be replacing one Wireless Access Point (WAP) at a time.  These replacements will take place during regular business hours.  Devices connected to a WAP while it is being replaced, will automatically roam to the next closest WAP.  This changeover should seem unnoticed.

 


Accept the “netauth.uc.edu” authentication certificate on your wireless devices as early as Monday, Nov. 26 for Old Chem, and Wednesday, Nov. 28 for Rhodes/Baldwin.


After the upgrade has started, faculty, staff and students in these buildings may be prompted to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each wireless device they use to connect to UC_Secure. 

UC_Secure will require you to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each of your wireless devices only once. 

 


Techs will be in these buildings from 7 A.M. to 4 P.M., on the days of the upgrades.


UCIT Technicians and Contractors will replace wireless access points in offices, classrooms, hallways and study areas throughout these buildings from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., each day during the Wired Network Refresh. Wired and wireless network service (including UC_Secure and UC_Guest) will be available throughout the IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh Project.  

 


How to get help.


Please report any wireless network issues to either Megan Pfaltzgraff at 556-1243 or email pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu>  or Jim Jordan at 556-1985 or email jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu> .  We will notify UCIT technicians to resolve any issues.

 

You may visit the project website <http://www.uc.edu/ucit/maintenance/it-network-phone-refresh>  for more information about the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project. 

Thank you for your support of this priority project to provide the university a smarter, faster, and more secure network.

Clarification for Lab 13 11/26/18 4:03 PM



Can we get a clarification on Task 2 for the Unix lab. The description asks for a shell script but in class we reviewed Makefiles. It also asks us to create a tar file which I don't recall going over in class. Are these the requirements or should we be creating the two helloworld files and linking the dependencies in a makefile?

unit tests 11/26/18 2:05 PM



do we need to write unit tests for the constructor?

i would think that they are tested already by default when we test the other methods, since without them, we couldn't be testing the other methods.

IN GRATITUDE AT THANKSGIVING 
Dear Bearcats Family, 

Henry David Thoreau writes, “I am grateful for what I am and have. My thanksgiving is perpetual.” Yet it is easy to get caught up in the demands of daily life and overlook the many good things in our lives. Fortunately, we have the Thanksgiving holiday coming up to remind us to give thanks. Among the blessings I am grateful for are family, friends, health, home and the privilege of being part of our learning community.  

As we approach the holiday, I want you to know how much I appreciate all that you do to make the University of Cincinnati such a special place. Each of you, individually and collectively, share unique gifts that make our university’s tremendous success possible. 

Thanksgiving Day was founded to celebrate survival, unity and the fruits of harvest. For many in our society, however, the holiday season can intensify feelings of isolation and loneliness. During our break this week, may we all take time to embrace those who may need us. In the face of “virtual” demands, let’s strive to truly become present to those with whom we are gathered. 

Thank you to the campus organizations that have already scheduled activities to reach out, such as the Graduate Student Governance Association’s Thanksgiving Dinner for graduate students on November 20 and our Department of Resident Education and Development’s partnership with Bright Star Community Church and Crossroads Church on November 18 to assemble and distribute boxes of food to nearby families.

What do I need to do?

Signing in to your migrated email account will likely require you to change some information in your settings.

Please note: Sensitive data (e.g. social security numbers, credit card numbers, and/or medical records information) are classified as “restricted” per the university’s Data Governance and Classification Policy <https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/infosec/docs/archieved%20policies/Data_Governance_and_Classification_Policy_9.1.1.pdf> . No restricted data or export controlled data <http://researchcompliance.uc.edu/ExportControls/ExportControlBasics.aspx>  can be stored in OneDrive at this time.

Please review the following information below BEFORE the migration begins:

Don't worry--you can still get to your email online!


New Outlook Web App (online portal) 
https://mail.uc.edu
After the migration, you will still be able to access your email online via the Outlook Web App, even if your desktop client is not working yet.

NOTE: If this is your first time entering the new web portal, you will be asked to enter your language preference and time zone, (UTC – 5:00) Eastern Time (U.S. & Canada.

Visit the new Outlook Web App >> <https://mail.uc.edu/>  
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/875cc910a3ac765107d2cfcdb/images/a9cf5230-5648-4622-9305-599a270f6be5.png> 	

Troubleshooting: Sluggish Desktop Outlook?


A few people using Outlook have experienced their email client becoming ""slow"" after the migration. Typically, these individuals have a large number of items in their Inbox or have multiple mailboxes/calendars open. We've created a troubleshooting article to help resolve common Outlook performance issues.

View the Office 365 Outlook Slowness KB article >> <https://kb.uc.edu/KBArticles/Office365-OutlookSlowness.aspx>

Are you a UC student and a faculty/staff member?


If you currently have two separate UC email accounts, an employee and a student email, your mailboxes will be consolidated During this migration. All of your existing email addresses will continue to work during and after the migration, but they will be delivered to a single Inbox in Office 365.

NOTE: If you are a dual account holder, you will be notified by the Office 365 project team before your area's migration.

View more info on the website about dual accounts >> <https://www.uc.edu/ucit/maintenance/office365/what-to-expect1.html>

"[UCMC] UCMC- Goosedown Gazette + Upcoming Trips","Happy Nov. 15th Mountaineers!


If you were not at Wednesday’s meeting, you missed an informative presentation about Class 3, 4, and 5 mountaineering taught by Eli Sorna. 


Just a reminder there will be no general body meeting next Wednesday, Nov. 21st. Meetings will resume Wednesday, Nov. 28th.
 


You're probably sick and tired of hearing about the Goosedown Gazette but it is an important publication to record memories and adventures in the club. You are able to submit just about anything you want and there is a very high chance it will get published. This is a great way to go down in UCMC history! 
Some ideas:
-gear review
-trip review
-poetry
-pictures
-dreams
-educational outdoor material
-epics about your favorite Exec. member
-jokes
-leaves and dirt
-favorite camp recipes




Email your photos and articles to:  Austin.vesely44@gmail.com

Photos and articles are due by Nov. 22nd. 

Here is a link to past Goosedown Gazettes for ideas: http://ucmountaineering.weebly.com/goosedown-gazette.html <http://ucmountaineering.weebly.com/goosedown-gazette.html>

Hard copies are available at the meetings or from the office. If you have a story that you would like to have placed in the Goosedown, send a copy to the editor or bring it to a meeting.


Don't know what to do from Dec. 15th- Dec. 22nd? Here's a little something from UCMC member Corey Liebau:

Hey Mountaincats,

Come along for an adventure of backpacking and mountain climbing with views that cannot be found East of the Mississippi. We will start our trip at the world famous Carlsbad Caverns. After that, we will go to Guadeloupe National Park and climb the tallest peak in Texas. Next, we will cross the border into the slightly newer Mexico and climb the Organ Mountains. Organ mountains consists of beginner mountaineering and class 3 climbing (you will be using your hands to climb steep slopes and over boulders). There will likely be some repelling (there will be a clinic to go over repelling). The trip is beginner friendly although backpacking experience is recommended. Be prepared to get out of your comfort zone and get a couple of cactus needles in your leg. The dates are December 15-22. Hike lengths will be 5-7 miles with around 3000 feet of elevation gain a day. Trip costs $140 dollars. I have started collecting $50 deposits now please get them in by this Monday at noon because I can reserve a larger van to take more people. You can pay me by Venmo (Corey Liebau) or find me on campus. After Nov 21, I will announce the people that will be going. The decision will be based on experience, beginnerness, involvement with the club, and volunteering. Anyone that does not make the trip will have their deposit returned. 

Corey's contact info: 330-417-9005

**Email Phishing Alert**

A number of University of Cincinnati email users have recently reported receiving malicious emails, similar to the one below (see *Sample Phishing Email* below). TAKE CAUTION! The sender is not a representative of UC. The link they provide in the email does not lead to UC’s network, even though it appears to be a valid hyperlink. Access to the malicious site from the UC’s network has been blocked, but be aware that access can still be made via other networks, including non-UC wireless networks. Please remember that even if the message is from a valid UC mail account that does not mean that it should automatically be trusted! 

 

What is Phishing?

Phishing is the act of attempting to acquire information such as usernames, passwords, credit card and/or banking details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity by electronic communication (typically email).

 

What if I Received a Suspicious Email?

UC’s spam filters appear to have caught the majority of the malicious messages. If you have received a suspicious email, do not click on any links, fill out any forms or reply! All you have to do is delete the email.

 Clothing waste is a growing issue for city governments around the world, fashion brands and consumers. Most of us have far more clothing than we actually wear leading Americans to trash an average of 80lbs of textiles and clothing per year. Black Friday shopping season is around the corner and while sales are great they also lead to over consumption and poor gifting decisions. It is also worth noting that more American shop Black Friday weekend every year than voted in the 2016 presidential election. It is time to rethink the way we make, buy, use and dispose of clothing.
 
One way that YOU can help keep clothing out of landfill by participating in The Black Market clothing swap on Thursday, November 15th from 1-8pm. The event is hosted by the Sustainable Fashion Initiative (SFI) which is an organization working to make the fashion program at DAAP zero-waste.

I solved the Max Heap recursively and i'm blowing the stack after 4000 elements. Is this okay or do I have to solve with an iterative implementation?

________________________________

Queue Remove 11/11/18 4:55 PM



For the remove function of the priority queue the lab doc says: 

1.	      Remove – This will remove an item from the queue from the appropriate location.

Does this mean that we need to accept a value and remove that value from the queue, or does it mean we need to remove the item with the highest priority?

We have 3 labs left.   Lab 10 covers Graphs, Lab 11 covers HashTables (i.e. dictionary, aka HashMaps), and then a small lab on Unix using AWS Cloud9.   I will be covering the Unix lab hopefully during the next lecture.  I do not have a slide deck on this content, so if you miss this class, talk to your friends for the notes.

"[SAFETYNOTICE] Tomorrow's Veterans Day Ceremony Will Include Rifle Fire","Nov. 8, 2018

 

Dear UC Community, 

 

I want to make you aware that tomorrow's Veterans Day Ceremony will feature rifle fire (utilizing blank ammunition)—a long-standing military tradition used to honor veterans who have served their country during war.

 

The ceremony begins at 10 a.m. on McMicken Commons, and the rifle firing will be performed at about 10:45 a.m. 

 

The customary military honor consists of a team of trained rifle experts firing three volleys from seven rifles. Blank ammunition, which does not expel a bullet will be used, but the rifles will make a substantial noise. The firing should be complete in less than a minute. UC's Department of Public Safety has authorized the firing, and campus police will attend the event.  For more details about the event, visit: http://www.uc.edu/news/nr.aspx?id=25728. 

 

I hope you will join me and other members of the university community as we honor our U.S. military veterans.  

 

Sincerely, 

James L. Whalen

Director of Public Safety

How much work is involved?

Although there will be several pre/post departure sessions and activities, this course will not meet weekly. Most coursework will be completed on the ground in Ireland. Students will also be expected to complete several course assignments throughout the spring semester and during their stay in Ireland.

 

How much will it cost? 

$3750, which includes: Airfare, ground transportation, accommodations, admission costs to scheduled cultural sites, and some meals. This cost is a preliminary estimate and may vary slightly.

 

Who can apply?

Any undergraduate student may apply. Students must register for PD2060 (3 credit hours), during the summer semester. Students will receive DC credit for the course. 

 

How do I apply? 

Visit http://bit.ly/ucireland and complete an application. Applicants will be admitted based on quality of application and interview. Accepted applicants will have additional time to decide on program commitment.

"[CEAS-UG] A Couple Things Off The Top Of My Head","First. I hope everyone is doing OK. I know the week prior to midterms through the end of semester can be a rollercoaster ride of stress, caffeine, and anxiety. Please please make sure you are eating, drinking some non-caffeinated/non-alcoholic beverages, sleeping, talking to other humans, and getting outside of your head. Do something joyful and non-academic/non-work-related every day. Please. And if you see me in the hall or elevator, if you could remind me to do the same.*wink* Even co-op has ramped up quite a bit by now with work and responsibilities and/or you are totally rethinking your entire life. Take a deep breath. You all will make your way. Promise.

 

Second. The university is closed on Monday, November 12, 2018. Veteran’s Day. For those that were unaware or forgot…you’re welcome! And to our veterans, thank you so much for your service. Truly.

 

Third. If you haven’t filled out the FAFSA for next year. You should do this. The application opens Oct 1st of every year now. Best to do it sooner rather than later.  FAFSA <https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa> 

 

Fourth and maybe final thought. There is a page of info on the UC website that may be helpful. Includes all the main links to support type services, financials, recreation stuff, identity center info, student life, counseling center, wellness center, blah blah lots of stuff that may be useful to you. Perhaps bookmark. Go here: Page of Awesome <https://www.uc.edu/students.html> 

 

I lied. I do have another thought. If you haven’t checked in with your advisor, please feel free. If you haven’t checked in with co-op advisor and are co-oping next semester, please do.

 

Okay. That’s it. Get your winter jackets out (unless you’re co-oping somewhere warm). It’s getting cold and I think I saw snowflakes on the weather app for next week.

 

Take care…and remember you’re amazing in at least one way…

"Five Tips for Managing Your Student Loans"," 	  <https://www.mohela.com/Misc/EmailCampaign/Images/mohela-fed-no-fsa.bmp> 	 <https://www.mohela.com/Misc/EmailCampaign/Images/servicerlogo2-test.png> 	
 	 
Brayden,

Here are some helpful tips to manage your account: 

*	Create an online account and Go Paperless – Log into mohela.com <https://www.mohela.com/>  to keep tabs on your student loan balance. 
*	Pay now vs. later – You are not required to make payments at this time. *However, if you can afford to make even some payments, it can save you money down the road and reduce the total amount that you repay. 
*	Interest Accrual – Interest accrues daily on Direct Unsubsidized and Direct PLUS Loans. If the interest isn’t paid prior to entering repayment, it will capitalize (be added to your principal balance). 
*	On the go? Download our free iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mohela/id1082597420?mt=8#>  or Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohela.MOHELA>  Mobile App for easy account access. Check your balance and even make payments when you are on the go. 
*	Contact us – Don’t forget to contact us if any of your contact information has changed. Or call us at 888.866.4352 if you have questions regarding your student loan. 

For more details about your account, sign in <https://www.mohela.com/>  to your online account on mohela.com. You can make a payment <https://www.mohela.com/dl/resourceCenter/paymentMethods.aspx>  at any time to reduce your principal balance or pay accrued interest to save money down the road.

Fail Faster



There is a concept called Fail Faster, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDjrOaoHz9s&vl=en this gives a quick view of it).  But basically you try something out, and if it doesn't work you change course.  And if that doesn't work, you change course from your experience.

So I have to admit I have been doing a little experiment with the Labs.   As the way the labs have been done in the past is the class is split up into groups of 4.  And then it is up to the group to decide how to split up the work.  With the lab report stating how much work did every do (in the perfect world, everyone says everyone did 25%).

And from the educators perspective this has been fine.   From the other end of the equation, as an employer looking for coops to hire.  I have found when I ask questions from Data Structures, a certain set of students will state, oh for that lab my partners did that lab.  Basically, they are admitting they didn't bother to figure out the concept and let their lab mates do the work.  Drilling down, it sounds like the students rotate who does the work on which labs, i.e a group of 4 students, has 2 do a lab one week, and the other 2 the other week and so on.  And for the record this antecodatal evidence still holds, as I ran into it during some coop interviews I was involved with a couple of weeks ago.

The other reason why educators so far have liked this format is due having to only grade 10 labs reports, instead of 40.

So I did made a hypothesis that I could make labs up that could be done by individuals, but could be easy to grade using UnitTests.  This seemed to work well, except that half you didn't like it.  So I modified things so that we would be more free-form, but this puts a lot of effort on the TA and me to grade.  And results from the survey show that half of you don't like this format.

And the breakdown of the classes opinion on this matter is 50/50 at the moment.   So I think what we should do is both.  For certain labs they will be individual with pre-built UnitTests and certain interface to provide.  And for other labs will be group projects, with a more formalized lab report.    My goal would be for half the labs to be group and the other half to be individual.  With my criteria is how critical the concept is, for example the LinkedList Lab is very important for everyone to know how to implement.

Lab09 will be a group lab.  Which means you will need to organize into groups of 4.  I will provide matchmaking services for those students who need it.  And for the record, I hate being in groups as a student (so if you are groaning, I'm there with you).  But from being able to grade a lab, and providing free-form capability, this is the compromise.

The second change is for the lab period, it is still mandatory to show up.   But you can leave once you show me your Interfaces (header files of the API), and the UnitTests you have written to test that interface.

"Voting Address Letter Utility Now Available","
As likely you are aware, November 6, 2018 is Mid-term General Elections Day in Ohio and across the nation.

Some of you may have used your school address as your address of residence to register to vote.  If you vote in person on Election Day, you will need an acceptable form of ID for voting.  If you do not have an Ohio driver's license, State of Ohio ID card, or a military ID, you can use a document supplied by University of Cincinnati that shows your name and your local address.  To obtain this voting address document, you will login to Catalyst for access to an address document-generation utility.

IF YOU WISH TO UPDATE YOUR CATALYST ADDRESS(ES) PRIOR TO CREATING YOUR VOTING ADDRESS DOCUMENT
 
1)  Go to Catalyst at https://catalyst.uc.edu.  Log in.
 
2)  Upon login, you will be on the ""Student Homepage"" dashboard.  
 
3)  Click the ""My Profile"" tile.  
 
4)  The resulting screen will be ""Update Profile.""
 
5)  Click ""Addresses.""  Update or add your address(es) as appropriate.
 
 
TO OBTAIN YOUR VOTING ADDRESS DOCUMENT
 
1)   Go to Catalyst at https://catalyst.uc.edu.  Log in.
 
2)   Upon login, you will be on the ""Student Homepage"" dashboard.  
 
3)   Click the ""Quick Links & Helpful Contacts"" tab.

4)  On the resulting page, click ""Address Letter for Voting"" at the top of the left-side navigation menu.

5)  Select the appropriate address.  Click ""Download Letter.""
 
6)   A letter will be generated that you will be able to print.  Take this letter with you to your voting station on November 6 to present as identification.
 
Please submit any questions you may have about the Catalyst voting address document or Catalyst address update to reginfo@uc.edu.


IMPORTANT NOTE

If the address printed on the UC voting purposes letter matches the address under which you are registered to vote in the State of Ohio, this letter is proof of identity and will allow you to vote a regular ballot on Election Day.

If you present the UC proof-of-identity letter to your Ohio voting station, do not also present conflicting non-Ohio identification.  If you do so, you may be required to submit a provisional ballot.

***********************************************
VOTING INFORMATION RESOURCES

The Ohio Secretary of State web-site offers extensive voting-related information at https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/

You can check your voter registration status, find information regarding identification requirements, and learn about absentee voting from the Ohio Secretary of State's web site at https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/voters/

Need input for Labs for rest of Semester



I have setup a Survey Monkey for feedback

I need to know which format to setup the labs.  The more structured type (starter solution files, unit Tests, but interface that must be implemented) OR more freeform.  You have experienced both types up to this point, so the question is which type should we use for our last 3 labs, plus supplemental lab assignments.

My next question is how should the lab time be spent?  I can't help but notice a large portion of you leaving the room before the end of class time.   And this might be a side effect of you each doing an individual lab, as opposed to working in teams.   So the question I have for you is, how should that time be spent constructively?

UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

October 31, 2018

 

Dear UC Community,

 

Recent days have presented us with shocking and savage reminders that we can never assume that prejudice, hate and horrific violence do not exist in our society. 

 

On Saturday during Sabbath Day at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, a gunman killed 11 people and injured six more in that sacred place of worship. His anti-Semitic threats on social media show that he targeted the victims because of their religious beliefs. Prior to that, a white man killed a woman and a man, both African American, at a Kroger in Kentucky. The suspect reportedly told a bystander that “whites don’t kill whites.” Witnesses say he also tried to enter a predominantly African American church minutes before the shooting at the grocery store. And last week a bomber mailed explosive devices to several prominent leaders and organizations whom he vilified on social media for their world views and political affiliations. The suspect fortunately was apprehended before any bombs detonated.

 

For me, it is heartbreaking to see not only the presence of hate, but also the absence of humanity revealed in these despicable acts. Our deeply felt condolences go out to the family and friends of those who have lost their lives and suffered injury. 

 

It has been an agonizing time of terror and violence not just for the communities affected, but also for our entire nation. That the cornerstones of our identity and democracy — race, religion and politics — have been targeted in such vicious ways is appalling. Yet the root causes of these injustices reside within our communities, not outside of them. Prejudice, hate, isolation and extremism are realities we cannot ignore or underestimate. They require an answer from each and all of us — more open hearts and fewer closed minds, more “us” rather than “others,” and above all, empathy over objectification.      

 

If you need help coping with these events, our campus has resources to help:

*        For students, Counseling & Psychological Services <https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps.html>  offers a 24-Hour Crisis Helpline at (513) 556- 0648.

*        For faculty and staff, IMPACT Employee Assistance and Work/Life Program <https://www.uc.edu/hr/benefits/eap.html>  offers a 24-Hour Helpline at (800) 227-6007.

 

Our campus community also is invited to show our solidarity against violence by joining in a Havdalah Memorial Vigil at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, November 3, at 2615 Clifton Avenue, hosted by Cincinnati Hillel and co-sponsored by several UC organizations in memory of the lives lost at the Tree of Life congregation.

 

The greatest path to healing is to stand up and say “enough” through our own peaceful and life-loving actions. In our daily lives, each of us must become ambassadors for our democratic values and ideals, and live them into action. Show each other and the world that #WeChooseLove, that we are all members of the same human family, and we are called to be #StrongerThanHate.

 

Sincerely,

 

Neville Pinto
President

"Service Hours Requirement 2018-19 - NEW ONLINE REPORTING OPTION REMINDER","Good afternoon,

 

This email outlines key resources to assist you as you plan your year ahead and the completion of your required hours of community service and continued scholarship renewal.  All of your service hours must be completed between the first day of fall semester and the last day of spring semester, regardless of enrollment plans.  

 

**If you do not plan to renew your scholarship for 2019/20 because of graduation, you are not required to complete service hours this year.**

 

SERVICE WEBSITES

Be sure to utilize the Web pages that provide you key information on the scholarship service requirement.  The pages are easily accessed at https://financialaid.uc.edu/  using the Cincinnatus link on the left-hand navigation bar.  You can also link directly to information via https://financialaid.uc.edu/cincinnatusprogram/cincinnatusservice.html <https://financialaid.uc.edu/cincinnatusprogram/cincinnatusservice.html>  .

Be sure to read all bullet points under Community Service Requirements.

 

SERVICE HOURS REPORTING

To help streamline the reporting process and allow scholars the option to keep their hours all in one place to track throughout the year, you will now be able to report all hours online if you wish by following the steps below.  Please keep in mind that we will still review your self-reported hours to make sure that they do meet the definition of service ""Those services designed to improve the quality of life for community residents (general public), particularly low income individuals, or solving problems related to their needs.""  – National Community Service Act of 1990

 

STEPS TO REPORT SERVICE HOURS ONLINE:

 

1.	Navigate to volunteer.uc.edu
2.	Log in as a volunteer (if you don’t already have an account, you will be prompted to make one)
3.	Click “add hours” in the navigation bar at the top of the site
4.	Answer the question “Are these hours in reference to a need you responded to on this site?” 

	a.	If yes, select the need from the drop-down menu and answer the questions the site prompts you with
	b.	If no, you will need to provide us with the name of the organization with whom you volunteered, the name of your contact there, and the email address where we can reach them to verify your hours – in addition to answering the questions the site prompts you with

 

Therefore, all hours that you may submit on paper form can be submitted online instead if you wish.  

 

Paper forms are still accepted as well for this year if you would prefer rather than online.  Please do not submit in both places.

 

SERVICE LISTSERV

 

The Center for Community Engagement remains a key partner in helping Cincinnatus students fulfill their service requirements.  As part of our commitment to provide you with ready information on service opportunities (most of which meet the Cincinnatus service requirements), we hope you receive the weekly service update via the Center for Community Engagement listserv.  

 

We hope this information is helpful as you look to fulfill your scholarship service requirement for the year ahead.  Please continue to contact us at 513-556-2420, option 1, or cincinnatus@uc.edu <mailto:cincinnatus@uc.edu>  with questions regarding your scholarship or the service requirement.

I implemented these two functions with cout statements making the methods void. I just re-read your lab document and it mentioned to make them return the string and then output that string in the EXE. Can I keep this the way it is or do you want me to go back and change it?

"exception thrown: Access violation writing location","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

exception thrown: Access violation writing location



so, i wrote this lab to work for int's originally because: A) its a lot easier as far as I can tell and B) there were a lot more resources/tutorials on how to do so for ints. 

I've got everything working for ints and have tried to switch over to using strings now; i had tested this previously in my other ide (without implementing it as a class, just a bunch of functions in a cpp file, because i was being lazy) and the conversion there was simple, no problem. 

Now i'm getting an error when i try to run the program: Access violation writing location 0xCDCDCDCDCD. And at the bottom of VS, under autos, it's telling me that there is an error reading characters of string? i don't understand why that would be true. 

i've attached a screen shot to try to provide as much info as possible:

"[CEAS-UG] Reminder - IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh - ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER","Dear Faculty, Staff and Students, 

This is a reminder notification regarding the Wireless Network Refresh in ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER, which is scheduled to begin the end of this week, Friday, Nov. 2, & Monday, Nov. 5.  


What you need to know.


There is expected to be no disruption of wireless service during the upgrade.


UCIT technicians will be replacing one Wireless Access Point (WAP) at a time.  These replacements will take place during regular business hours.  Devices connected to a WAP while it is being replaced, will automatically roam to the next closest WAP.  This changeover should seem unnoticed.

 


Accept the “netauth.uc.edu” authentication certificate on your wireless devices as early as Thursday, Nov. 1.


After the upgrade has started, faculty, staff and students in ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER may be prompted to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each wireless device they use to connect to UC_Secure. 

UC_Secure will require you to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each of your wireless devices only once. 

 


Techs will be in ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER from 7 A.M. to 4 P.M., Friday, Nov. 2, & Monday, Nov. 5.


UCIT Technicians and Contractors will replace wireless access points in offices, classrooms, hallways and study areas throughout ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., during the Wired Network Refresh. Wired and wireless network service (including UC_Secure and UC_Guest) will be available throughout the IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh Project.  

 


How to get help.


Please report any wireless network issues to either Megan Pfaltzgraff at 556-1243 or email pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu>  or Jim Jordan at 556-1985 or email jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu> .  We will notify UCIT technicians to resolve any issues.

**Please note:  There have been reports of trouble accessing UC_Secure on Windows 7 computers after the Wireless Refresh. Please visit the IT@UC Knowledge Base article “UC_Secure Windows 7 Reconfiguration Instructions” <https://kb.uc.edu/kbarticles/UC_Secure-Win7reconfig.aspx>  for a work-around.**

 

You may visit the project website <http://www.uc.edu/ucit/maintenance/it-network-phone-refresh>  for more information about the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project. 

Thank you for your support of this priority project to provide the university a smarter, faster, and more secure network.

"Node class defined seperately","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Node class defined seperately



I have almost finished this lab but when I re-read the word doc I realized it said:

1.	     Create a Binary Search Tree class with the following methods.  This class should contain a node that is defined separately to hold a string.  
2.	      Insert – accepts a node that is created outside this class.  This will find the correct place to insert the node and insert it.

So would this be unacceptable to do then?

class BST
{
public:
     struct node
     {
          node* left;
          node* right;
          std::string key;
     };

"Deleting a struct object","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Deleting a struct object



Is it even necessary to create a destructor for a struct, or will calling delete on it automatically remove the object from memory? For example, this is my node object:

 <https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=attach%2Fjjbejny713g1fj%2Fjldu98ssp9540o%2Fjnrswme9lzx9%2Fnode_object.png> 

Node * node = new Node(1);
delete node;

Is this sufficient to delete that node?

Balanced BST tree (Red-Black looks to be easier to implement)



So I have been doing some research and I think the Red-Black tree might be an easier implementation.   As I have found a youtube series from a guy who explains it well. And it references a Algorithms book which I own.  So I should be able to whip up a power point slide deck on how to use this.  I still don't get why our book didn't explain this concept well :(

Start Here

Rotations

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95s3ndZRGbk

If you could watch these videos (combined they take about 20 mins total).  Then I can go over at the start of the class about the pseudo-code from the algorithm book this series references.

________________________________

GetAllAscending and GetAllDescending 10/25/18 9:19 PM



for these two functions can we turn these into recursive functions with an input of the root? Otherwise they have to iterate through the entire tree with a while loop and (what I think would be) quite a few conditionals. We could use a default input such as

std::string * BinaryTree::GetAllDescending(Node * start = root)

Restructuring binary search tree to keep it balanced



Hello Patrick,

I was wondering if for Lab 7 you expected us to restructure the binary search tree after each insert to make sure it is well balanced?  I don't see anything about it in the lab report, but I wanted to make sure.

*	Kalmar (Växjö), Sweden <https://usac.edu/study-abroad-programs/sweden/vaxjo-kalmar/about> 

Summer 2019 | Application Deadline | March 1st 

Växjö is the capital of the Kronoberg region in southeastern Sweden. It was an important trading center as early as the eighth century and is located in the heart of the “Kingdom of Crystal,” so-called because world famous glassworks such as Kosta Boda and Orrefors are located there. Växjö is also known for its high-tech industry, paper and furniture manufacturing.

 

The area around Växjö has forests, pristine lakes, hiking trails and unspoiled countryside, making it an attractive area for those who love the outdoors. There is a rich cultural life as well as an active nightlife. You can visit beautiful medieval churches and historic castle ruins, a modern concert hall, cafés, museums, a cathedral and the Swedish Emigrant Institute, which commemorates the great emigration from 1850 to 1930 when 1.3 million Swedes immigrated to the US.

 

Exchange:

*	Japan: Nagoya University (Exchange) <https://studyabroad.uc.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10094> 

January application deadlines for Fall 2019 term and Academic Year

Nagoya University is one of the most prestigious and popular public universities in Japan ranked #10 in the top universities in Asia. The university is located in Nagoya, the capital of the Aichi Prefecture, which offers ample opportunities to explore the large amount of museums, the bustling entertainment district, and various other outdoor activities.

This is one of UC’s International Exchange Programs.  These programs are great because the cost is the same as the University of Cincinnati. In fact, tuition and fees are paid the same way they are when a student is on campus.

*	Guatemala: The Global Technical Workforce <https://studyabroad.uc.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10287> 

Spring 2019 | Application deadline extended to October 31st 

The program focuses around a 7 day visit to Guatemala, officially the Republic of Guatemala. During the 7 day trip, students will get a chance to visit 3 unique regions of Guatemala. The first portion of the trip will involve 3 days in Antiqua. Antiqua is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala famous for its well-preserved Spanish Baroque influenced architecture as well as a number of spectacular ruins of colonial churches. It once served as the capital of Guatemala, and it has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The second portion of the visit will include a day trip to Lake Atitilan. Lake Atitalan is a lake in the Guatemalan Highlands of the Sierra Madre mountain range. The lake is surrounded by many villages in which Maya culture is still prevalent and traditional dress is worn. The third portion of the trip will head to Guatemala City. Guatemala City, locally known as Guatemala or Guate, is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Guatemala, and the most populous in Central America. There will be an opportunity here to visit a couple museums, an open-air market, and climb an active volcano. There will also be the opportunity to visit the UVG campus in Guatemala City.

*	Guatemala: Leadership Latte <https://studyabroad.uc.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10150> 

Spring Break 2019 | Application Deadline | November 1st  

The focus of the course is on culture, gender and leadership in Guatemala. During four pre-departure class meetings we will cover topics such as culture, gender, leadership, sustainable development, the coffee market and the impact of the global marketplace on the lives of coffee workers and their families. A final ""debriefing"" class meeting to share reflections and learning will meet in April a few weeks after we return.

Service Learning:  Work with families on a coffee farm to accomplish community goals. Projects have included building playgrounds for a local school and outhouses for families. We will be housed at Los Andes, a Private Nature Reserve where families live and produce coffee. This farm is internationally recognized for its focus on sustainability and environmental efforts.  It is situated four hours from any major urban area, at the foot of the beautiful volcano Atitlan. Additional activities include bird watching, visiting Colonial/Mayan ruins, and a trip to a coastal beach.

Subject: JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Program (Full-time & Summer Internships)

Hi Dr. Purdy, Dr. Rabiee, & Dr. Bhatnagar,

By way of introduction, my name is Theresa Hui and I'm one of the recruiting managers at JPMorgan Chase supporting our Software Engineering Programs on the Campus Recruiting team.  I wanted to reach out to you to seek your assistance.  This semester, we added U. Cincinnati to our school roster in hopes to augmenting our pipeline for our Programs particularly for the Columbus Tech Hub. However, we only noticed that there is a handful of applications from this school.  We have been on-campus  for a few events and will be returning later this week to bring our Tech Showcase to life which features five key tech innovative areas that the Firm has embarked on (10/24//18 @ Tangeman University Center - Student Union from 11AM - 2PM).

I would like to solicit your help in telling your students about this full-time and summer internship opportunities as well as our upcoming Tech Showcase.  Attached are the job descriptions for our programs along with the links below to apply.  Feel free to forward or distribute to your students widely.  I also plan to reach out to Patti Carroll in the Employer Partner Services Department to see if she can help me with this effort to drive student interest.

I'm happy to further discuss these opportunities with you in more details via phone if you like.  Feel free to reach out if you or any students have any questions about these programs or our recruiting process.  Thank you in advance for your assistance!

printing time difference



I'm getting a weird error in visual studio when i try to use the "" std::cout << ""Delta t2-t1: "" 
<< std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(t2 - t1).count()
<< "" nanoseconds"" << std::endl;""

in the attached screen shot, you can see it working in another ide and failing in studio (i hovered over the error reading in VS). 

both files have the line ""typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock Clock;"" underneath where i include all the different libraries. 

i don't understand why cloud9 (the top ide) is accepting it but VS is not. they are both including the same libraries and, as you can see in the VS screen shot, the function is accepting the class object ""Clock"" for t1 and t2 (no error there, as far as I can tell).  <https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=attach%2Fjjbejny713g1fj%2Fjlfonj5s7ho1v9%2Fjnkk7rl2r74z%2Fchrono_error.png>

"Sorting times in lab 6","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Sorting times in lab 6



Do you expect us to get sorting times similar to the values in your table? For example, at n=500 for the bubble sort you have 25004ms but I am getting <500ms for that test.

Or do you just want us to demonstrate the contrast between them rather than aiming for a certain time?

"[Instr Note] Lab assignments","Instructor Patrick Olekas posted a new Note. Your instructor selected to notify everyone in real time of this post, bypassing user email preferences.

Lab assignments



So when we don't have a solution as a starting template for the labs,  and when I tell you to zip you solution. 

What that means is I want you to zip up the top level of your solution.  This covers the directory that contains the sln file, plus the sub directories of the projects (which covers the code - hxx and cxx files, and vcxproj).   Otherwise I have to spend 5-10 minutes per submission of recreating the project and solution, just to run the code. This  is on top of the 5-10 minutes I spend grading the lab itself.   So something that takes 5 minutes * 40 students (200 mins), will take twice as long.

I will grade your lab05 like this, but  going forward if no solution file and other files are not provide, you will receive zero on the lab assignment.   This is the only warning I will give on this.

Lab 6 question 10/20/18 3:39 PM



In lab 6 do you want us to actually do anything with the arrays that we sort (i.e. return them from the sorting methods when they're finished) or is it fine if we just pass in a copy of the array to the method and have it return void?

Example:

void Sort::bubbleSort(int array[])

Thanks.

Getting the above ""4 errors"" when I try to build the stack13 game. i've looked through old, working projects where we used an exe file and tried to copy their syntax as best i can; i can't seem to spot the difference. 

the below is in my header file: #ifdef STACK13_EXPORTS
#define STACK13_API __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define STACK13_API __declspec(dllimport)
#endif
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <list>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

and each of my classes has the ""STACK13_API"" bit in them as well. 

Am I missing something?

vector instead of list for lab 5?



are we allowed to use a vector instead of a list, by chance, for the deck? I seem to remember you having said something about vectors to the effect that we were allowed but that it might make things more difficult. maybe that was for lab 6 though?

"[CEAS-UG] Exploring Culture, Life, and Work Abroad This Spring - PD2010","Greetings,

Interested in working abroad but not sure where to start? Want to learn more about what it takes to find an international co-op or internship? There’s a course for that. PD2010 - Exploring Culture, Life, and Work Abroad is a new course designed to introduce students to concepts and practices necessary to successfully live and work abroad and provide an overview of international program options at the university. The course will allow you to explore your own Cultural Intelligence and develop a personalized plan for improvement while exploring the traits of a culture of your choice. This course is open to students in all majors, provides DC/SE BOK credit, and can be used as a substitute for the Introduction to International Co-op course, for students interested in the International Co-op Program!

Have questions? Please feel free to reply to this email, and I’ll be happy to assist. See the attached flyer for additional details.

Error that player class doesn't have a member that is written



When writing my unittests I try to call my function validStackAdd, which checks if the card being added to the task is the next card in order (ie. if ace is down, you are trying to add a two to the stack). When I call the method, it returns that the method does not exist. <https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=attach%2Fjjbejny713g1fj%2Fjlc8ct6zohv51t%2Fjnepgu31j1s4%2FCapture.JPG>

BST remove case



I posted my slide deck from EECE4040 on BST removal.   I had trouble recalling the third case (when there are two children, and I thought I had this slide deck uploaded already).   But I think these pictures help.

And then also don't forget the visualization page - https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html

however, when i search the file, there is no other instance of SetRank(); what purpose was it written in there for and why, exactly, is it a bad idea?

Here's what has happened in EECE 2080C on Piazza:


________________________________

const Card * 10/16/18 1:34 PM



I made a slight mistake in what I said about const Card *.  As I stated that you can't delete the the object pointed to by a const Card * 

This is incorrect, what a const Card * will do is make sure you don't modify the Card object (for instance if you have a SetRank method on it that wasn't decorated with the const keyword).   I confused another language when I said this.

A good read on this is this article - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11866174/prevent-delete-on-pointer-in-c

----

However, using a const pointer is still valid.  For instance if we had People and Pets.  And we had a AddPet or RemovePet method on People.  We could declard it so that that can't be called on a const pointer to a People.    So this would be a compile error

const People * person = SomeMethod();

person->RemovePet();   // this will give a compile error

person->GetName();  // While this is legal if GetName is declared as being const.

I think I will alter this lab for the next class such that the Object being passed around can be modified, but we want to restrict who can modify it.

"[CEAS-UG] ACCEND Student Panel Thursday","Hello CEAS!

ACM@UC will be a joint meeting with IEEE this Thursday, October 18th at 6:00pm in CRC 3250; please note the time and room change. We will be having an EECS ACCEND panel with current upperclassmen in the program, ready to talk about their experiences and answer your questions.

As always, there will be free pizza.

What is ACCEND?

ACCEND is a program that can allow you to do a master's (MS, MBA, or MEng) at the same time as your bachelor's degree. We will be focusing on some common questions about the program, such as: 

*	How much does it cost?
*	What is an MS, an MBA, and an MEng, and do employers want these degrees more?
*	What are graduate classes like?
*	Is a Master's worth it?
*	Is it worth doing before or after working in industry for a couple years?
*	How many classes do you need to take?

Immediately after the meeting, ACM-W will be holding a talk about successfully maneuvering negotiations on the job.

"[CEAS-EECS-UG] IEEE Meeting 10/18 - ACCEND panel","Hello!

IEEE will be having its next meeting on Thursday, 10/18 at 6:00pm in CRC 3250. We will be talking about our plans for the rest of the semester and how you can get involved.

Additionally, we will be having an ACCEND panel with ACM! Come prepared with questions about the ACCEND program that we can answer. There will be 5th year students in ACCEND that can help answer them. 

Finally, ACM-W will be having a meeting right after ours about having successful negotiations - be sure to check it out!

More info below!




ACCEND is a program that can allow you to do a master's (MS, MBA, or MEng) at the same time as your bachelor's degree. We will be answering some common questions about the program, such as:

 

*	How much does it cost? 
*	What is an MS or an MBA, and do employers want these degrees more?
*	What are graduate classes like?
*	Is a Master's worth it? 
*	Is it worth doing before or after working in industry for a couple years?
*	How many classes do you need to take?

 

All these questions have their own answers and depend on your circumstances, so please come, enjoy free food, learn about IEEE, and ask any questions you have about the program!

"C++ pointer syntax referece","Your classmate posted a new Note. 

C++ pointer syntax referece



Since we are working with pointers, I found this stackoverflow thread to contain some useful information on how to read pointers in C++

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143262/what-is-the-difference-between-const-int-const-int-const-and-int-const

From one of the posts:

Read it backwards (as driven by Clockwise/Spiral Rule <http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html> ):

*	int* - pointer to int
*	int const * - pointer to const int
*	int * const - const pointer to int
*	int const * const - const pointer to const int

Now the first const can be on either side of the type so:

*	const int * == int const *
*	const int * const == int const * const

If you want to go really crazy you can do things like this:

*	int ** - pointer to pointer to int
*	int ** const - a const pointer to a pointer to an int
*	int * const * - a pointer to a const pointer to an int
*	int const ** - a pointer to a pointer to a const int
*	int * const * const - a const pointer to a const pointer to an int
*	...

The exam is to be taken in class correct? I only ask because I went to one of my midterms only to find an empty class and was then told that it could be taken at home.

"Question on 13 rules","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Question on 13 rules



So other than a player discarding their entire hand and drawing 5 cards, or deliberately choosing to end their turn, what exactly forces a player to end their turn? Is there a certain number of moves they can make per turn?

It seems like with the given rules, the first player allowed to move can simply draw and discard from their hand until they win without ever giving the other player a chance, assuming they don't perform one of the actions above.

"[CEAS-UG] IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh - ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER","Dear Faculty, Staff and Students, 

This is an early notification to provide information regarding the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project.  Phase 2, the Wireless Network Refresh, in ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 2, & Monday, Nov. 5.


What you need to know.


There is expected to be no disruption of wireless service during the upgrade.


UCIT technicians will be replacing one Wireless Access Point (WAP) at a time.  These replacements will take place during regular business hours.  Devices connected to a WAP while it is being replaced, will automatically roam to the next closest WAP.  This changeover should seem unnoticed.

 


Accept the “netauth.uc.edu” authentication certificate on your wireless devices as early as Thursday, Nov. 1.


After the upgrade has started, faculty, staff and students in ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER may be prompted to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each wireless device they use to connect to UC_Secure. 

UC_Secure will require you to accept the “netauth.uc.edu” certificate on each of your wireless devices only once. 

 


Techs will be in ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER from 7 A.M. to 4 P.M., Friday, Nov. 2, & Monday, Nov. 5.


UCIT Technicians and Contractors will replace wireless access points in offices, classrooms, hallways and study areas throughout ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., during the Wired Network Refresh. Wired and wireless network service (including UC_Secure and UC_Guest) will be available throughout the IT NEXT: Wireless Network Refresh Project.  

 


How to get help.


Please report any wireless network issues to either Megan Pfaltzgraff at 556-1243 or email pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:pfaltzmm@ucmail.uc.edu>  or Jim Jordan at 556-1985 or email jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu <mailto:jordajw@ucmail.uc.edu> .  We will notify UCIT technicians to resolve any issues.

 

You may visit the project website <http://www.uc.edu/ucit/maintenance/it-network-phone-refresh>  for more information about the IT NEXT: Network & Telephone Refresh Project. 

Thank you for your support of this priority project to provide the university a smarter, faster, and more secure network.

13 Rules 10/07/18 4:37 PM

Hi,

I'm unclear as to how you win 13. I googled it but it seems to be a completely different game than described in the word doc. The word doc just describes how the hand works.
Questions:
I see that they try to ""make a stack"", can it be 13->1 or just 1->13?
Is it scored based on how far they get each turn or how many cards they add * point value?
Does the stack reset each turn or is the goal to be the first one to finish your stack?

The rules are:
1. Each player must end their turn with 5 or fewer cards in their hand.
2. At the start of their turn, they must draw a card from the top of the community pile of cards (AKA as the Deck class - *implement using a queue)
3. The player then tries to make a stack from their hand in order from 1 to 13 during their turn. *implement using a stack
4. During their turn, the player may draw additional cards from the top of the pile so long as the total cards in their hand don’t exceed 6.
5. When the player cannot place any more cards in their stack and they have 6 cards in their hand, they must discard 1 card to the bottom of the community pile.
6. A player may choose to discard all of their cards to the bottom of the community pile and start with 5 new cards at the beginning of their turn. This action ends their turn without them getting a chance to draw a 6th card or discard any cards to their stack.
7. The game is played with a standard playing card deck (Ace = 1, Jack = 11, Queen =12, King = 13). The suits are not important for the purposes of determining rule 3 (i.e. a 4 of any suit can go on top of a 3 of any suit).

Thanks,

Purpose of the card class



Hello,

I am wondering what the purpose of having the card as a class is?  If we only have to worry about the value of the card and not the suit wouldn't it be easier just to represent the card as an integer between 1 and 13?

"Safety Alert","Oct. 7, 2018 
 
Dear UC Community,
 
Please be aware that it was reported on Oct. 7 that a sexual assault occurred in the lot of the Group Health Building on Clifton Ave. The victim and suspect are known to one another.
 
Sexual assault includes sexual conduct or contact, as well as other activity of a sexual nature, without the consent of the other person or when knowing the other person is unable to consent.  Sexual assault can range from voyeurism and public indecency to sexual imposition and rape.  Consent is informed, freely given, mutual and can be withdrawn at any time. For more information on consent, please go to http://www.uc.edu/titleix/policies-definitions.html <http://www.uc.edu/titleix/policies-definitions.html> .
 
If you or someone you know is a victim of a gender-based or sexual assault crime and do not want to file a police report, you can make a report with Title IX at http://www.uc.edu/titleix.html <http://www.uc.edu/titleix.html> . For campus and community gender-based and sexual assault support services, visit www.uc.edu/safe <http://www.uc.edu/safe> .
 
Important Safety Tips:
Responsibility for sexual imposition and assault lies with the perpetrators, not the survivor.  Most offenders assault someone they know.  No one deserves, asks for, or provokes sexual imposition or assault.  The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing such a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.

	
*	
	If you see something, say something.  It’s on all of us to keep campus safe. Visit https://www.uc.edu/wellness/topic_areas/bystander-intervention.html <https://www.uc.edu/wellness/topic_areas/bystander-intervention.html>  for more information on Bystander Intervention training. 
*	
	If you observe suspicious activity, or are a victim of a crime, call 911. 
*	
	Trust your instincts.  If you feel unsafe, get to a safe place and call for help.
*	
	NightRide is a free evening shuttle, call 513-556-RIDE.
*	
	Download the Bearcat Guardian app for additional resources.  The app is available for free on the App Store or Google Play.  Search “Rave Guardian.”

In a non-emergency situation you can reach UCPD at 513-556-1111 or Cincinnati Police at 513-765-1212.  For more information about UC’s safety resources, including the Bearcat Guardian app, visit www.uc.edu/publicsafety <http://www.uc.edu/publicsafety> .

Lab05 Due date moved (sort of)



I have decided to move back the due date for Lab05.  I have added in assignment that is due on Monday though.  I want to see your class design for this lab.  I have put on blackboard what I am looking for so I won't duplicate that information.

This is worth 20% of lab05.  This will also allow me to give you feedback on your design.  Pay special attention to use pointers, use const pointers when you are supposed.  You only need to provide the class definition, not the implementation (i.e. i.e your header file should compile, but it is OK if you can't build a DLL with it).

Please see the attached survey below about the possibility of having a golf room in the Campus Recreational Center. There was a lot of debate on if students would be interested in this or not, so we are using this survey to help determine that. Please take a minute to fill this out before our next senate meeting on Wednesday. If you have any questions/concerns you’d like me to bring to the senate floor, do not hesitate to reach out.

Tribunal Senators,

 

Good afternoon! There was a lot of discussion in Senate yesterday surrounding the bill regarding a golf room in the CRC. I've made a survey which has been approved by Alex (who presented to us yesterday). If you could forward this on to your tribunals/colleges I would greatly appreciate it. Let me know if you have any questions!

Campus Rec Trainer Tip: Equipment Tutorial

 

Check-out this video on how to use the weight equipment <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8x5Q-rgIIY>  on the Fitness Floor like a pro! Here are some tips to keep in mind:

*	
	The machines work on simple switches
	
*	
	The machine will pull the heaviest weight selected
	
*	
	If no weight is selected, it will pull 10 lbs. or whatever the lightest weight is
*	
	Schedule a free Fitness Floor Orientation <https://uc.edu/campusrec/membership/smart.html>  at any time at Member Services or online <https://uc.edu/campusrec/membership.html#MainContent_text_5> .

"[Instr Note] UnitTests - Revised","Instructor Patrick Olekas posted a new Note. Your instructor selected to notify everyone in real time of this post, bypassing user email preferences.

UnitTests - Revised



So in playing around with the Sample code, I ended up changing my initial design in my mind to take out some classes and just have them be private data members.

So I am revising the Unit Test requirement, and I'm posting it here:

I want you to write UnitTests for those bits of functionality I called out for Task2.   So if you represent the player's hand as a list as a private data member, I want you to write 3 unit tests for that portion.  For example, maybe having testing the functionality to make sure you error out if the Player ever has more than 6 cards in their hand.

 

Alternatively if you represent the Player's Hand as  a class, you will still want to have functionality to test condition of too many cards being allowed in the hand.  It is just a question of where that functionality is (Either in Player.AddCardToHand() which does the all the checking and then adds to the list,   or where Player.AddCardToHand() calls  PlayerHand.AddCard(), which does the checking)

So you are not required to write 3 tests for each class, but I am relaxing this to be 3 unit tests for each concept mentioned.   As I don't want to limit you design choices, or to make needless classes if you don't want to.

Post Lab 4 questions: Exceptions 10/01/18 1:07 PM



After completing lab 4, i still have 2 questions:

1.	i've googled std::exception e and read a few different pages/posts (on stackoverflow, cplusplus, etc) and i still don't quite understand what we are doing there. what is the intended purpose of this catch?
2.	in the recursion.h file, we were given these two lines of code:

*	class RECURSIONLIST_API MyException : public std::exception {};
*	extern RECURSIONLIST_API void SimpleExceptionMethod(int i);

i tried it with both, as above and with the class line commented out; both ways still work/compile/pass the unit tests. i was reading on how to create user defined exceptions and i saw from other sources that they used a line like the first line (with class in it) and then made a public function in there. are all 3 of these ways valid ways to create user defined exceptions? if so, what made you choose the above way? and how exactly is it working?

Whoops this got stuck in draft folder.

Recall you CANNOT directly run a DLL.  You need a EXE or Test to execute your code.   Here is  a pic to show you where/how to do this.

actuallly use LIst



Since we want to get to the contents of the entire stack\queue we need to use list. You can use list like a stack or queue using the right methods.  I have put  up a simple example showing this, and highlight some of the  memory management issues to be concerned with.  This is on the lab assignment , and I'll go over this in Lab.

Also there is no quiz today but I will be taking attendance.

Error for factorial larger than 5000



I am confused about what error you want me to screenshot when doing a factorial larger than 5000.  I understand that I will get the wrong value, but no error is thrown since the integer just wraps around to a negative number.  Am I just supposed to screenshot the wrong number or what?

"Non-Coding Questions: Citing and Lab Report","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Non-Coding Questions: Citing and Lab Report



1.	During the course of writing the queen solver and exception (WIP) code, i found myself over at sanfoundry.com frequently. How should i cite them, both for this class and for professional purposes?
2.	In the Lab Doc, under ""Lab Grading"" it says ""20% - Lab report contains all required information and is well written"" - are we supposed to actually write something in this document? I thought we were just sharing the screen shots indicated in the Lab Doc. I skimmed through here, piazza, and the syllabus and I am unsure what you are looking for us to write, if anything, beyond maybe answering the question: ""But alter one of the testcase to try to solve a large number for the recursive case (say 5000).   What do you think will happen, run that testcase and take a snap shot of error that occurs""

________________________________

Array dimensions in lab 4 9/29/18 2:31 PM



In RecursionList.h the instructor defined the 2D array m_board as having the size [8][8] which would make the chessboard a 9x9. Shouldn't we change those dimensions to [7][7] and the bounds of the for loops in the ChessBoard class as well to make it an 8x8 board for the problem?

What exactly should the ChessBoard::ToString() function be outputting? Should it print out the entire 8x8 array while it is solving the problem? Or just at the end? Or something else

"[SAFETYNOTICE] Annual Security and Fire Safety Report","Sept. 28, 2018

 

Dear students, faculty and staff, 

 

The University of Cincinnati is committed to providing a safe place to live, work, study and visit. Part of this effort includes sharing information regarding the safety and security of our campuses.

 

A document important to your safety, the University of Cincinnati’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, is now available on the Public Safety website at https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/publicsafety/docs/2018%20Annual%20Security%20and%20Fire%20Safety%20Report.pdf. This report is required by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act).

 

In the report you can learn about UC’s institutional policies concerning campus security, including sexual assault and other matters, how UC educates the community about safety through UC Aware email notifications and other educational outreach initiatives, and how UC issues timely warnings (Safety Alerts) for emergencies and crimes that present a serious or continuing threat to safety.  Additionally, the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report includes crime statistics that occurred during the 2015-2017 calendar years:  

*         On campus;

*         Off-campus in buildings or property owned or controlled by the university or university recognized student organizations;

*         And on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from UC’s campuses.

 

As required by the 2008 amendments to the Higher Education Opportunity Act, the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report also contains fire prevention policies and information about fire safety equipment within university owned and/or operated on-campus residence halls. In addition, the report includes statistics for all fire events that occurred in campus residence halls during the 2015-2017 calendar years. 

 

Please familiarize yourself with the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. For more information about the programs and policies outlined in the report, or to request a paper copy, call 513-556-4900 or email publicsafety@uc.edu <mailto:publicsafety@uc.edu> . 

 

Sincerely, 

James L. Whalen

Director of Public Safety

"[CEAS-UG] Capturing the Flag - Tonight!","Hello CEAS,

 

Come learn about civic engagement and the importance of voting by joining Student Government in watching Capturing the Flag! The movie is TONIGHT at 6:00 PM, in TUC Cinema. After the movie, there will be a Q&A session from a panel of voter experts and the film maker herself, Anna De Mare!

 

If you’re unfamiliar with what Capturing The Flag is, see the attached descriptions/quotes below:

 

A tight-knit group of friends travel to Cumberland County, North Carolina - 2016 “posterchild” for voter suppression - intent on proving that the big idea of American democracy can be defended by small acts of individual citizens.

 

We are using screenings of the film as organizing events to catalyze larger conversations around voting, civil rights, election reform, fair redistricting and the importance of college students’ participation in the 2020 census. The goals of our campaign are to Educate, Engage, Empower and Activate, leveraging the film to support campus Get Out The Vote efforts, pro-democracy volunteerism and civic engagement in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections and beyond.

 

“I can read about voter suppression and hear about voter suppression, but seeing it unfold on screen is staggering in an entirely different way.”  - Full Frame Artistic Director Sadie Tillery quoted in PBS’s DocSoup

"Safety Alert","Sept. 25, 2018

 

Dear UC Community,

 

Please be aware that it was reported on Sept. 24, 2018, that a sexual assault occurred on Sept. 21, 2018, in University Square Apartments. The victim and the suspect are known to one another.

 

Sexual assault includes sexual conduct or contact, as well as other activity of a sexual nature, without the consent of the other person or when knowing the other person is unable to consent.  Sexual assault can range from voyeurism and public indecency to sexual imposition and rape.  Consent is informed, freely given, mutual and can be withdrawn at any time. For more information on consent, please go to http://www.uc.edu/titleix/policies-definitions.html. 

 

If you or someone you know is a victim of a gender-based or sexual assault crime and do not want to file a police report, you can make a report with Title IX at http://www.uc.edu/titleix.html. For campus and community gender-based and sexual assault support services, visit http://www.uc.edu/ucwc/advocacy.html.

 

Important Safety Tips:

Responsibility for sexual assault lies with the perpetrators, not the survivor.  Most offenders assault someone they know.  No one deserves, asks for, or provokes sexual assault.  The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing such a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance. 

 

*	If you see something, say something.  It’s on all of us to keep campus safe. Visit https://orgsync.com/145405/chapter for more information on Bystander Intervention training.  
*	If you observe suspicious activity, or are a victim of a crime, call 911.

The Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival will debut September 26-30, 2018 and present stories that celebrate the human spirit. The festival champions the curious, the brave, the dreamers, the open-hearted, the vulnerable, the unheard. The Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival is a place where media and culture reflect and value all – where differences and empathy become a source of strength and joy.  
 
Organized by LADD, a local non-profit that supports adults with disabilities to live, work and connect, the Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival takes place throughout Cincinnati’s historic neighborhood, Over-the-Rhine. Formerly, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, the newly-named festival will showcase five tracks: freedom, diversity, identity, disability, and faith. Over 65 short and feature films have been selected by the curation team. The Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival will host celebrities, red carpet events, parties, and a Global Village with world music performed by local and national DJs. The festival will have a bevy of special events, “pre and post” movie receptions, the OTR Global Village Scavenger Hunt, and conversations that feature festival filmmakers and talent.

Quiz 4



So Quiz 4 is going to be really hard today.  I am going to devote it to giving you time to fill out the survey monkey.  So to get a 100% on the quiz you just need to show up today.  And hopefully fill out the survey, but since it is anonymous, I won't really know if you did or didn't :)

Subject: University Honors Program Application
Importance: High

 

Hello Tribunal Senators,

 

I’m Jason Autry. I’ve been an advisor for the University Honors Program for the past four years, and starting this summer, I assumed all of our admissions responsibilities, which includes our University Honors application process. This has always been an opportunity for current UC students to apply for admission to our program. We know that there are a number of extremely talented and motivated students all across campus who didn’t get invited through our initial first-year admissions process. That process is super competitive, and we’re making decisions based on their high school achievements. The UHP Application process is different, and that’s where we need your help. We are looking for passionate, curious, and motivated students who are looking for ways to make an impact to the communities that are or become important to them. We strive to find students who seek to be empowered by our vision: Developing students into global citizen scholars who lead innovative efforts toward solving the world’s complex problems. 

 

As valued student leaders, I want to reach out to find the best ways to share our program’s opportunities to the students who would be excited to join our program. My hope is that you would at least share this information with your friends, peers throughout your colleges, your student organizations, and anyone else you think would be interested. 

 

Here are some quick details about the process: 

 

*	Applications will be available from September 21 through November 26.
*	Students must be full-time, undergraduate students with an overall 3.2 GPA by the end of the fall semester.
*	Admitted students will take a 1 credit-hour class in the spring to learn how to excel in the program.
*	General interest meetings will be hosted in the UHP Suite in Swift 700 on October 4 and October 17.

 

All of the information and application can be found here: https://www.uc.edu/honors/prospective/transition.html <https://www.uc.edu/honors/prospective/transition.html>  and from our main page: https://www.uc.edu/honors.html. If this is the first you’ve heard of us, take a look through our page. 

 

If there’s something more we can do or if you need more information, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Push and Pop being Booleans 9/23/18 4:50 PM

Hi Professor Olekas,

In the file you define push and pop as booleans, and in the unit tests they test for true in false. But in the lab write up and by common sense pop should return an int.

From Lab 3 write up
""The pop function should return a value from the stack. If the stack is empty, it should print out an error message to the screen stating the stack is empty then exit the function without modifying the stack.""

Won't it mess up my game if I try to force pop into being essentially a delete functions? When you pop a disk off one row and put it to another I need to know its value.

Thanks,

Count is being set to 0 after While Loop. Not sure why



 <https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=attach%2Fjjbejny713g1fj%2Fjlcvkzxwtya3av%2Fjmf9t6lcluvx%2Fwhileloop.PNG> 

Count = 4 when going into the while loop. When i > count, the loop exits but then count is somehow equal to zero. Count = 4 for each run through the loop but when the while loop condition is met, count = 0. I don't understand why. So when this is finished, count = -1.

"[CEAS-UG] Build Satellites with CubeCats!","Hi All!

 

UC CubeCats is a CubeSat (small satellite) club here on campus. We will be having a general meeting/potluck tomorrow (Thursday the 20th) in 3220 CRC at 7:00 PM. During the meeting we will go over what our club is all about, as well as lessons we learned at this year’s small satellite conference.

 

If you are a freshman (or any year really), this a great opportunity to learn about our CATiSE Program (High Altitude Balloon Program) as well as our CubeSat Program (Small Satellite Program). These programs are a great way to gain engineering experience for each major, and ultimately have a project you worked on orbiting the planet!

 

Be sure to bring friends tomorrow (and food if you are generous) and feel free stay afterwards to network with current UC CubeCats members to learn more about what our club has to offer.

 

I hope to see you all tomorrow!





Thank you,

"2018 Perceptions of Policing Survey","DATE: September 19, 2018
TO: Students, Faculty, and Staff
FROM: Robin Engel, PhD, Vice President for Safety and Reform
RE: 2018 UC Perceptions of Policing Survey

The continued safety of our UC community is of vital importance.  To enhance our efforts, we need to better understand your experiences with policing on or near campus. Collectively, our students, faculty, and staff have critical information that will help improve public safety and further guide our police reform agenda.

The University of Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research (IPR) is administering a web survey of all UC’s students, faculty, and staff.  The survey is intended to provide information about your perceptions regarding policing by UC Police and Cincinnati Police on or near campus.
 
The deadline for completing the survey is  October 4, 2018.
 
Your participation in the Web survey is completely voluntary and all results will be kept confidential.  Results will be summarized in such a way that no one person's responses can be distinguished.  Results of the survey will contribute to our future development, safety enhancements, and reform agenda. The survey is sponsored by UC’s Office of Safety and Reform.
 
This study has been reviewed by the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board (IRB) and determined to be for quality improvement of the UC Police. If you have any questions, please contact Dr. Robin Engel, Vice President for Safety and Reform at (513) 556-5849 or Dr. Eric Rademacher with IPR at (513) 556-5028.

For your convenience this survey can be completed easily and quickly on-line.  First, open your browser and enter the following Web address:

When you go to the survey Web site, you will be asked to enter your unique survey ID:

"[CEAS-UG] Fall 2018 Technical Career Fair *Booklets Attached*","Hello CEAS,

 

As you are all hopefully aware, tomorrow is the Technical Career Fair. As always, the Career Fair will run from 10am to 3 pm. This Fall we will be having TWO locations hosting a total of 238 companies, with the first being in the TUC Study Space/Atrium (3rd  Floor TUC) and the second being in the Recreational Center Basketball Courts.


Please do not forget the dress is business professional and to bring your bearcat card to the fair, as both are required for entry. 

 

We will have bag-check available at the door as no coats or backpacks are allowed on the floor of the career fair. However, bag-check is susceptible to long lines, and it is HIGHLY encouraged, if possible, to not bring a bag or coat to the fair.

 

Attached to this email are the booklets for the two locations of the Technical Career Fair. In the booklet you will find information about attending companies and at which location they will be found.

 

In addition, you can view all companies attending the Technical Career Fair on our website at tribunal.uc.edu/careerfair/students <https://tribunal.uc.edu/careerfair/students.php?sub=companies&ref=students> .

"[SAFETYNOTICE] Perceptions of Policing Survey – Your Input is Needed","Dear UC Students, Faculty and Staff,

 

Your safety and experience with our police officers matters!  The Office of Safety and Reform <https://www.uc.edu/publicsafety/reform.html>  is working to provide effective and equitable policing for our campus community, with the goal of becoming a national model for best practices in urban-university policing.  To help guide our work, I am again asking for your input about your experiences with the University of Cincinnati Police Division <http://uc.edu/publicsafety>  (UCPD).  Your thoughts and opinions are critical to enhance our safety and reform efforts.

 

To systematically capture individual perspectives and experiences, all fulltime UC students from the Uptown East and West campuses, along with all faculty and staff will receive an email later today from Eric Rademacher, from the UC Institute for Policy Research, with an invitation to participate in an online survey titled Perceptions of Policing Survey.

 

Survey responses will be compared to those gathered in 2016 and 2017, to measure our progress. The results from previous surveys have been used to guide our development, safety enhancements, and reform agenda.  I encourage you to share your thoughts. Please be part of the conversation.

 

Best Regards,

Files to submit for lab 3



In the lab write up it states:

""Include all source code from all tasks, input and output files (if any), and any special instructions to compile and run those programs.""

Does this mean you want the entire project folder? Or can I just submit the following in a zip (assuming modifications made in all)

*	lab report doc
*	TowersHannoiGame.cpp
*	StackQueues.cpp
*	StackQueues.h
*	moves.txt

I'm also not sure what it means by special instructions to start the game since I assume the code will be tested from visual studio on your end.

Thanks

Lab 02 Question



I completed Lab 02 but I'm confused about something. When deleting a node say: nodeDelete. If I do not call nodeDelete->setNext(nullptr); before I call delete nodeDelete; | everything past that node will be deleted. It deletes the node, but every node after it is lost. setNext is simply a pointer so why do I lose all of my memory after it?

"Phishing Alert","========= IT@UC Office of Information Security Alert Bulletin ========


**Email Phishing Alert**
A number of University of Cincinnati email users have recently reported receiving malicious emails, similar to the one below (see *Sample Phishing Email* below). TAKE CAUTION! The sender is not a representative of UC. The sender claims to have a copy of your password, and demands a payment in a crypto currency known as Bitcoin. 

These scams are becoming more common, and often times the credentials used are from old breaches from non-UC systems and services. We have no reason to believe that any UC System has been compromised as part of this phishing campaign.  


What if I Received a Suspicious Email?
UC’s spam filters appear to have caught the majority of the malicious messages. 
If you have received a suspicious email: 

*	Do NOT click on any links. 
*	Do NOT fill out any forms. 
*	Do NOT reply. 
*	Delete the email. 
*	If the message contains a password that you are currently using, CHANGE THAT PASSWORD IMMEDIATLEY. 


*Sample Phishing Email Reported*
I am aware turbo2012 is your password. Lets get right to the purpose. You do not know me and you are probably thinking why you are getting this e mail? Absolutely no one has paid me to check about you. 

In fact, I placed a malware on the 18+ video clips (sex sites) web-site and do you know what, you visited this website to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your internet browser initiated functioning as a Remote control Desktop that has a key logger which gave me accessibility to your screen and web camera. Immediately after that, my software program obtained all of your contacts from your Messenger, social networks, as well as email . Next I created a double video. First part shows the video you were watching (you have a good taste : )), and next part displays the view of your webcam, & its u. 

You get 2 solutions. Shall we explore the options in details: 

1st solution is to just ignore this e mail. Consequently, I am going to send your actual video to each of your your contacts and then just consider concerning the humiliation you feel. Not to forget if you are in a relationship, precisely how it will eventually affect? 

Next solution would be to compensate me $7000. Lets name it as a donation. As a consequence, I most certainly will straightaway delete your videotape. You can resume everyday life like this never occurred and you will not hear back again from me. 

You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search for ""how to buy bitcoin"" in Google). 

BTC Address to send to: 1K2tAGtD6X1BBw2kMM9AdP6g6dp8VdBRfq 
[case SENSITIVE so copy and paste it] 

If you may be looking at going to the cops, okay, this email message cannot be traced back to me. I have covered my steps. I am just not attempting to ask you for a lot, I just want to be paid. 

You have one day to make the payment. I've a specific pixel in this mail, and right now I know that you have read this e-mail. If I don't receive the BitCoins, I will definitely send your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, coworkers, and so on. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the recording immediately. If you need evidence, reply with Yea! and I will send your video to your 10 friends. It's a non-negotiable offer, and so don't waste mine time & yours by responding to this email. 


What Can I Do to Help?
If you are aware of any users that received the message and clicked on the link, please instruct them to change their passwords as soon as possible via uc.edu/PSS or contact the UC Information Technologies Help Desk at 513-556-HELP (4357) for assistance.

Please distribute this Security Alert to anyone who you feel needs to be made aware.

Contact the UC Information Technologies Help Desk at 513-556-HELP (4357) or toll-free at 866-397-3382 or the IT@UC Office of Information Security at 513-558-ISEC (4732) with any questions or concerns.

YOU’RE INVITED TO THE 2018 OVER-THE-RHINE INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL!
 
The Producers of the Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival would like to invite you to this wonderful cinematic celebration in the City of Cincinnati! They want to make sure that University of Cincinnati students are included in this event that is presenting stories that celebrates the human spirit. See the ticket graphic attached for a code to get a free ticket to any film at the festival. 
 
The Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival will debut September 26-30, 2018 and present stories that celebrate the human spirit. The festival champions the curious, the brave, the dreamers, the open-hearted, the vulnerable, the unheard. The Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival is a place where media and culture reflect and value all – where differences and empathy become a source of strength and joy.  
 
Organized by LADD, a local non-profit that supports adults with disabilities to live, work and connect, the Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival takes place throughout Cincinnati’s historic neighborhood, Over-the-Rhine. Formerly, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, the newly-named festival will showcase five tracks: freedom, diversity, identity, disability, and faith. Over 65 short and feature films have been selected by the curation team. The Over-the-Rhine International Film Festival will host celebrities, red carpet events, parties, and a Global Village with world music performed by local and national DJs. The festival will have a bevy of special events, “pre and post” movie receptions, the OTR Global Village Scavenger Hunt, and conversations that feature festival filmmakers and talent. 
 
Limited quantities available! Don’t miss out! www.otrfilmfest.org <https://www.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17adf2dfe1e5d7d355b632521&id=b32fb09e6f&e=d23cb63ca3>

One drive is breaking my project and I don't know why or how to fix it. I was working on the project then for no reason it randomly wouldn't build. I now cannot run the project because I think every time I open it one drive tries to sync up and removes the files, I am unable to work on my project at all

"[CEAS-EECS-UG] Enrollment Dates for Spring term","Dear EECS Students,

 

Here are directions to find your Enrollment dates for Spring semester:

 

Go to the My Academics Tab in Catalyst

Click on Calendars and Deadlines

Click on View Assigned Enrollment Time

Select the term

 

You will see your Shopping Cart dates (the dates on which you can add to the Shopping Cart) at the top, followed by your own Open Enrollment Dates and times. These dates and times vary from person to person. Your advisors do not know your specific date. You may find this information on your own by following the directions indicated above.

 

The courses for EECS are still being added to Catalyst: they will be finalized within the next few weeks, far in advance of your enrollment dates. Please be patient as it will take at least another week before all of your courses are viewable in Catalyst.

 

As always, we ask that you do not reply to the listserv emails.  If you have questions, contact your faculty or staff advisor for assistance.

 

Thank you!

"[CEAS-UG] Career Fair Volunteers","Hello again,
 
As all of you hopefully know, the fall Technical Career Fair is fast approaching. That being said, we are going to need many people to make this event a success, and CEAS Tribunal would appreciate your help in making that happen. Below is a link to sign up for time slots the week of the Career Fair (September 18 - September 21).
             
I highly encourage you to volunteer, as it is a great last minute resume booster. Additionally, the volunteers who put in the most hours will be given gift cards. If you have any questions or concerns regarding volunteering for Career Fair, please feel free to reach out. Below are also answers to two of the most commonly asked questions.
 
Link to sign up for Career Fair: https://goo.gl/forms/ziohgXywrpFgkIWs2 
 <https://goo.gl/forms/ziohgXywrpFgkIWs2> 
Career Fair Volunteering <https://goo.gl/forms/ziohgXywrpFgkIWs2> 
goo.gl
Please fill out the below survey if you are interested in volunteering for the UC Fall Career Week. You will hear back with more details early next week.


1.	What attire should/can I wear?

Professional dress for Tuesday (9/18), Wednesday (9/19), and Friday (9/21) is not necessary. These days involve purely set up for the Career Fair and tear down after the Career Fair, so come as you are, it's only going to be volunteers present. However, dress for the day of career fair is business professional (no shorts, no jeans, no gym shoes, etc.). This is required for all attendees and volunteers as company representatives will be there. 
 

2.	Does this count for Cincinnatus?

The service hours from this event do not count towards Cincinnatus service hours because it does not qualify based on the standards for the Cincinnatus Scholarship Program.
 
Thank you for your help and we hope to see you there!

I'm having issues when it comes to removing removing the nodes. Everytime I call to destroy it it detroys everything after it too, is there a way to prevent that from happening?

 Please read the following note from Ralph as it may answer some of your questions on the Lab 2 pre-work. 

""On the lab 2 prework, question 3 says to use figure 1 for the calculations, however, you will need to use figure 2 for the load line calculations.""

""Question 4 on the prework of lab 2 states that you will need to record the values of the reverse current, Ir, in figure 3, however, these should be recorded in figure 6. I have notified Jason of the mistake. 

Also, the question states that there will be a screencast but J has not posted any. Try your best to figure out question 4 of the prework. If you are unable to complete it, we will discuss it in class and you won't be penalized for it.""

"Safety Alert","September 10, 2018

 

Dear UC Community,

 

Please be aware that UCPD is investigating multiple reports of sexual imposition by a known suspect reported to have occurred in the past week in Daniels Hall, where the suspect was a resident. The known suspect initiated or attempted to initiate inappropriate contact with female students. The suspect has been removed from Daniels Hall.

 

Sexual assault includes sexual conduct or contact, as well as other activity of a sexual nature, without the consent of the other person or when knowing the other person is unable to consent.  Sexual assault can range from voyeurism and public indecency to sexual imposition and rape.  Consent is informed, freely given, mutual and can be withdrawn at any time. For more information on consent, please go to http://www.uc.edu/titleix/policies-definitions.html. 

 

If you or someone you know is a victim of a gender-based or sexual assault crime and do not want to file a police report, you can make a report with Title IX at http://www.uc.edu/titleix.html. For campus and community gender-based and sexual assault support services, visit http://www.uc.edu/ucwc/advocacy.html.

 

Important Safety Tips:

Responsibility for sexual imposition and assault lies with the perpetrators, not the survivor.  Most offenders assault someone they know.  No one deserves, asks for, or provokes sexual imposition or assault.  The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing such a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance. 

*         If you see something, say something.  It’s on all of us to keep campus safe. Visit https://orgsync.com/145405/chapter for more information on Bystander Intervention training.  

*         If you observe suspicious activity, or are a victim of a crime, call 911.  

*         Trust your instincts.  If you feel unsafe, get to a safe place and call for help.

*         NightRide is a free evening shuttle, call 513-556-RIDE.

*         Download the Bearcat Guardian app for additional resources.  The app is available for free on the App Store or Google Play.  Search “Rave Guardian.”

 

In a non-emergency situation you can reach UCPD at 513-556-1111 or Cincinnati Police at 513-765-1212.  For more information about UC’s safety resources, including the Bearcat Guardian app, visit www.uc.edu/publicsafety <http://www.uc.edu/publicsafety> .

"[Instr Note] Questions from a student","Instructor Patrick Olekas posted a new Note. 

Questions from a student



Student questions:
-you have test, exe, and dll. Are they copies of each other, whats the difference?
The main dll, Lab01DLL contains the implementation of the code  you are implementing.   This is required as MS unit  framework only works  on DLLs.
The exe is there as a touchstone to your previous class.  If you want write your code and execute it before runnning the tests you can.  But you are not requried to do anything with the exe.  It is there for your convenience.
And lastly there is  the test dll.  This is the one you should run to make sure you can tests correctly.
-running unit tests
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/writing-unit-tests-for-c-cpp-with-the-microsoft-unit-testing-framework-for-cpp?view=vs-2015 
-running main
I have the exe as the startup project.  So if you hit green play button this will run it in debug.
-how does a header file connect with its “subfile” as in why do we have 2 different. How do I know when to define something in the header vs the other
The ONLY file you should be modifying are the  Lab01 CPP and possibly the header file.  The point of header file is to share the interface amongst your source file.  Otherwise you would have to multiple copies and keep them in sync- also why is there a header for most sourcefiles
When you create a project using VS it generates a lot of ""standard"" files.  Technically they are not needed.  And they could probalby be removed, I just didn't bother.

I had a typo in the lab02 where I called the ArrayBasedLinkedList PointerBasedLinkedList and vice versa.  I have fixed this and re-uploaded the zip.  If you have already started you probably already saw this typo.

That awesome mentorship program you've been looking for? We have it!


The Student Government Mentorship Program is aimed at undergraduate students who have an interest in the formal leadership procedures of the Undergraduate Student Government or would like to participate in a 9-month dialogue to improve leadership skills and abilities. 

SGMP educates program members on the processes of Student Government and how to facilitate institutional change. Using intergroup dialogue, one-on-one mentorship, guest speakers, and project based learning, SGMP further develops leaders that are familiar with Student Government processes and prepares them to become successful campus leaders. This program is open to any first or second-year student and closes September 8th at midnight!

"Build Errors in Lab 1","Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Build Errors in Lab 1



Hi Professor Olekas,

When I try to build Lab 1 I obtain the following errors:

 <https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=attach%2Fjjbejny713g1fj%2Fjlch6617sha3u7%2Fjlol1k091sf0%2FCapture.PNG> 

The second warning is just bad, but workable, methodology on my part.

The other ones I'm confused by; I've only edited lab01dll.cpp, but all the other warnings/errors are in other files. I didn't think I needed to edit anything besides lab01dll.cpp so I don't want to mess with it aimlessly.

Thanks

"[CEAS-UG] ChemE Car Meeting - Tomorrow, Wednesday, September 5th","Hello,

 

I hope everyone is having a great start to the Fall semester!

                

ChemE Car will be having our first meeting of the semester TOMORROW, Wednesday, September 5th, in 605 ERC at 6pm.

 

ChemE Car is open to ALL MAJORS!

 

ChemE Car is a competition among universities to build a shoebox-sized car that runs off of a chemical process. However, there are many aspects other than chemistry that go into the design, building, and testing of this car. That is why all majors are valuable to the team.

 

If you are interested but unable to attend this meeting, please send me an email at penninbd@mail.uc.edu <mailto:penninbd@mail.uc.edu> .

Also, please feel free to email me with any questions about ChemE car, or if you would like to know more about what we do!

 

Once again, our meeting will be THIS Wednesday, September 5th, in 605 ERC at 6pm.

 

I hope to see everyone there!

"[CEAS-UG] Triangle Fraternity Fall Rush","I hope everyone had a good first week of classes and great labor day weekend! 




My name is Alex Hoyle and I am the president of Triangle Fraternity here at the University of Cincinnati. Despite being called Triangle (and yes, our actual name is Triangle), we are a Greek social men's fraternity. Other than our unique name, what really sets us apart is that we only accept Engineers, Architects and Scientists. Because of our intensive majors, we have a different take on what it means to be a part of Greek Life; taking a heavy focus on our academics and professional development while also providing both social and philanthropic opportunities. In the Fall and Spring semesters, our chapter (composed of around 90% engineers) posted the #1 and #4 GPAs among all fraternities on campus while still providing all of the events that personify Greek life.




If Triangle sounds like something you are interested in, I would like to invite you to attend our rush events. They will be held throughout the next three weeks (schedule below). All of the events are located at our house, 2809 Swiss Chalet Ct (right across the street from DAAP), unless listed otherwise. 

	 Wednesday, September 5 @ 6:30pm - Giant Airplane Competition and Lawn Pong (Zimmer Auditorium Roof)

	Sunday, September 9 @ 2:00pm - Giant Inflatables

	Thursday, September 13 @ 6:30pm - Bengals Watch Party

	Friday, September 14 @ 6:30pm - DAAPture the Flag

	Saturday, September 15 @ 6:00pm - Tailgate at Sigma Sigma

	Monday, September 17 @ 6:30pm - Sumo Wrestling

	Tuesday, September 18 @ 6:30pm - Video Game Night

	Thursday, September 20 @ 6:30pm - ""Drive-In"" Scary Movie Night

	Friday, September 21 @ 6:30pm - Bonfire

	
	

If you have any questions regarding the events or Triangle in general, please contact our Rush Director, Bryan Gardiner, at (513) 427-5016 or uctrianglerecruitment@gmail.com  

I look forward to seeing you at one of our events!

"Re: 2188-1_20EECE2070L002 ((18FS-Full) ELECTRONICS LAB I (002)): No Lab Next Wednesday and More Details","Ashkan, 




On the lab one quiz, question 5, we are asked to figure out what voltage the multimeter is measuring, and the 'correct' answer is that it is measuring 'V-b'. However, point B is just a single point on a wire. I am not sure how the multimeter could be measuring the voltage at a single point when it is connected across multiple resistors. All of the other answers were measuring the voltage across multiple points such as 'V-ab' or 'V-bc'. Am I just misunderstanding the meaning of 'V-b'? If so, what is the meaning of this label?




Thank you,

Brayden Osborne

*	The link for submitting Lab 1 brief is available (two attempts allowed). It is due the end of Tuesday, Sept 4. After that, the link will not be available. I will finish grading the briefs on Wednesday, Sept 12, so you'd be able to go through it and avoid similar mistakes in upcoming reports. 
*	The lab brief template is posted on blackboard  ( /Course Documents/Templates and Data Sheets/Templates/Lab Brief Template ).  The submitted file should be a Single PDF containing the following items: 

	1.	Page 1 is the page 1 of the template (your name, class day, etc.) 
	2.	Page 2 is the page 2 of the template containing the lab objective (Write in your own words. DO NOT USE the same objective given to you on the lab write-ups). 
	3.	Page 3 will be the scan of the completed lab write-up handed to you in class. Each  group member should also include a scanned copy of their calculations on a separate sheet (one sheet of calculations per group member).  
	4.	After page 3, you will have your simulation results (typically 2-5 pages).  
	5.	Next comes each team member's analysis (typically 2-4 pages) and conclusion (typically 1 to 3 pages) 

*	Items 1-4 are shared sections (except the calculations sheet in item 3 which is one sheet per person). Item 5 (Analysis and Conclusion) is NOT a shared section meaning that each person writes his own analysis and conclusion and appends it to the end of the PDF file to be submitted. 
*	There are many details that you need to pay attention to when writing a technical report after you get a job. Hence, we practice writing a quality report in this class. Make sure you read the file ""E1 Lab Brief Format.pdf"" posted on BB ( /Course Documents/Templates and Data Sheets/Templates/Lab Brief Format )  for a review of these details and accompanied examples.   
*	The sheet of calculations mentioned in item 3 of the lab brief template above is essentially your lab pre-work which starting from next lab, you will submit in a separate link before the class (due one hour before the class and done on an Engineering paper) 
*	I have made discussion forums on the BB ( /Tools/Discussion Board ) to discuss questions related to lab brief/report and pre-work. Students who show good activity in the forums can claim extra credit added to their final grade. 

One last important note, There will be no class on next Wednesday, Sept 5th. That is  because the Monday class is off, and I'd like to keep the Wednesday class on the same schedule as the Monday section.   
Let me know if any question.  
Have a nice weekend, 
Ashkan

"[UCMC] Canoe Trip on Green/Colorado Rivers in Canyonlands Oct 3-9 (on river)","Hello Everyone:

I am leading a trip on the Green & Colorado Rivers in Canyonlands, 
launching from Moab on Oct 3rd and returning on the 9th.  Six days of 
paddling, about 60 river miles and one day exiting via ""jet"" boat.  Cost 
is $300 per person for canoe rental, and exit ride from take out on the 
Colorado River.  I have one spot open. You must be able to get to Moab 
by Oct 2nd.  If you fly, you will most likely need seven days off 
school; more if you opt to drive out.  Your tent/canoe partner would be 
Alireza Nemati, a Iranian transplant who got his PHD from UC last year 
and now lives in Detroit.  I have hiked and paddled with Ali extensively 
and can vouch for his character.  He has a fascinating life story to 
tell and is a lot of fun to travel with.   His canoe partner is making 
noises that he would like to bail out of this trip, hence this call for 
a replacement.

The trip itself is mostly still water paddling with frequent day hikes 
to see ancient Indian artwork, ruins, and gorgeous red rock canyons.  
The camping style will be more like car-camping than hiking, although 
everything must fit into a canoe.  Because the Green River is actually 
pretty silty, all water is carried for the seven days (about 20 gallons 
per boat).

If you are interested, please contact me asap.

"[Instr Note] Request on how to ask for help","Instructor Patrick Olekas posted a new Note. 

Request on how to ask for help



I have supervised (and currently) several coop students.  And one of the things I tell them is if they get stuck on something, please never say ""It doesn't work and I need help"".   It is more effective for both me and the student for you to take some time and sort out what doesn't work.  There is a fine balance between writing a novel asking for help, and giving no information or context.

Don't say ""I can't get Lab01 to build."".   Say When I attempt to build Lab01EXE project it gives an error about not finding Lab01DLL.h.   I have  gone into the project properties for LAB01EXE and I have set the Additional Header file directories to what I believe is the  correct directory.""    At this point you might then want to show what errors you are getting, and maybe a screenshot of the additional directories.

That gives me enough information to ask questions to help you solve your problem.   And sometimes, the process of forming your question will hit  upon the solution :)  Which is a win\win for both of us :)

This is rooted in the principles of Rubber Ducky Debugging (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)   The TLDR version - Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.

***********************************
* SETTING A SERVER-LEVEL PASSWORD *
***********************************

If you do not already have  a password for the LISTSERV.UC.EDU server, we
recommend that  you set one  now. A LISTSERV  password is linked  to your
subscribed address (Brayden Osborne  <osbornbs@MAIL.UC.EDU>) and is valid
for all lists to which you  are subscribed on the LISTSERV.UC.EDU server.
The same password can be used for email commands as well as for access to

"[CEAS-EECS-UG] FW: Local Electrical Experience/Service Hour Opportunity","Volunteer Opportunity – See email address below if you have questions.

 

Good afternoon, my name is Lydia Christopher and I am the Director of Volunteer Services at Heritage Village Museum and Educational Center in Sharonville, Ohio. Every year we host an event the last three weekends in October called Haunted Village. One of our biggest attractions is our Haunted Trail, which includes a variety of spooky vignettes. These vignettes include simple electrical setups (some drawings of which are attached) that one of our volunteers has designed and put up single handedly every year. This year he has requested some additional help and I was wondering if you could share this opportunity for some simple electrical engineering experience with the students in your department. 

This would be a great opportunity for anyone with an interest in electrical work in need of experience or students in need of service hours. The hours are very flexible and will depend entirely on the interested party’s availability. We would like to begin setup in early September and our head volunteer on this project has stated that he can be here pretty much whenever during the week or weekend. This work would be on an unpaid, volunteer basis and may include climbing stairs and ladders, lifting and carrying objects up to 50 pounds, walking, working outside and running of electrical cables and setups. We are located in Sharon Woods Park in Sharonville, so interested parties would need to arrange their own transportation. 

Any interested students should contact me via email at lchristopher@heritagevillagecincinnati.org <mailto:lchristopher@heritagevillagecincinnati.org>  no later than Friday September 7th.

"[CEAS-UG] Come be apart of CEAS Tribunal’s Innovation Committee!","Hello everyone!


I hope you all are enjoying your first week of classes! This semester, Jacob Neumann and I are the Innovation Chairs for the College of Engineering and Applied Science Tribunal. If you were at the first CEAS Tribunal general meeting, you heard me talk a little bit about some of the projects that the innovation committee is planning during the fall! 




A brief overview of the main new projects:





*	Engineers Can Paint Too (an engaging event that will demonstrate the creativity of engineering students by painting cardboard walls).
*	Face to Face (an event that will allow CEAS students to meet random fellow students in the college and spend two minutes to get to know each other, which will allow everyone to meet A LOT of people and make new friends).
*	Stress Relief (Group fitness activities to give you a break from engineering coursework and provide you with mental clarity). 
*	A few more projects are under development as well (your ideas WILL be considered)!

Do you want participate in the Innovation Committee and make these events a reality? SUBMIT YOUR INFORMATION HERE <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-C_fehucSre_KIZYHzEG3tHU7pjli357uaEvnCis0U-sGPA/viewform?usp=pp_url>  by the 6th of September and we will contact you with meeting information!

"[Instr Note] Quiz regraded and lab submission","Instructor Patrick Olekas posted a new Note. 

Quiz regraded and lab submission



I fixed the answer to quiz to be the right one and regraded the quiz.

And then a quick reminder (or if this is new), for the submissions, this will be done through blackboard.  You click on the lab link, and it will give you an option to submit files.  Please just submit the cpp file.  If you did modify the header file, submit that as well.  I find it easier to grade if you don't zip things up (another step to get to the files), so don't zip it up.   And definitely do not zip up the whole solution folders, we just want the implementation details.


Thanks!

Patrick

"[CEAS-UG] UPCOMING EVENTS: Event for Students and Student Mentors","CEAS Students,

 

UC is hosting Dr. Sandra McGuire next week to work with faculty, students, and student employees. Dr. McGuire is a nationally-recognized speaker on how students can learn to effectively study and master their course content. 

 

She’s speaking at two student sessions next Wednesday. The first is targeted for students working with other students (student leaders, mentors, TAs/GAs, etc.), the second is for all students seeking to improve their study strategies.

 

I’ve attached fliers for both events. Text descriptions and RSVP links are also below.

 

 

Speaker Bio:

Dr. Saundra Yancy McGuire, Director Emerita of the LSU Center for Academic Success and Retired Assistant Vice Chancellor and Professor of Chemistry, is an internationally recognized chemical educator, author and lecturer who has traveled the globe promoting sure-fire strategies to help students to be successful in their coursework and careers.

Session 1: Meeting the Challenges of Providing Effective Tutoring and Mentoring Sessions: Strategies that Work (Wednesday, September 5th from 3:00-4:30pm in TUC Great Hall)

This session is specifically for Peer Educators/Mentors at the University of Cincinnati.  

Many tutors and mentors are frustrated that students seem less interested in learning than in being “shown” how to do problems and answer questions.  This session will discuss the role of metacognition in effective tutoring, mentoring, and coaching. Participants will collaboratively develop concrete strategies that will make sessions with students more effective.

 

To RSVP for this session, use the following link: https://form.jotform.com/82264785358166 <https://form.jotform.com/82264785358166> 

 

 

Session 2: Metacognition: The Key to Acing Courses! (Wednesday, September 5th from 5:00-6:00pm in TUC Great Hall)

This session is open to all University of Cincinnati Students.  

All students who are admitted to college have the ability to ace their courses.  However, most students did not acquire effective learning strategies in high school, and resort to memorizing information just before tests. This strategy usually yields poor results, with students earning grades much lower than their ability.  This interactive workshop will introduce students to cognitive science based learning strategies that help all students experience meaningful, transferable learning, resulting in A’s in their courses!

Dr. McGuire's workshop is being offered as a part of the Learning Common’s Success Skills Workshop Series. Students can register for her talk and others on the Success Skills Workshop page.

To RSVP for this session, use the following link:  https://www.uc.edu/learningcommons/successskillsworkshops/workshopform.html <https://www.uc.edu/learningcommons/successskillsworkshops/workshopform.html>

"[CEAS-UG] Engineers Without Border Meeting - NOT CANCELLED!","Hi everyone,




Today's Engineers Without Borders meeting at 6 pm in CRC 3200 has not been cancelled! I believe someone was trying to update their personal calendar and accidentally sent it out to everyone. Sorry for the deluge of emails this week!




Additionally, due to high levels of interest and class conflicts, we have decided to add a second shorter introductory meeting today (Wednesday) at 5 pm in CRC 3210!




If this second time also doesn't work for you, here are our six committees with which you can get involved:

	
*	Nyambogo - Wednesdays @ 6:30 in Baldwin 662 - sanitation project
*	Roche - Thursdays @ 6 in Baldwin 648 - water project
*	Burere - Thursdays @ 6:30 in Baldwin 661 - water project
*	Community Outreach - Thursdays @ 5 in CRC 3210 - Cincinnati-based projects
*	Fundraising - Every other Monday @ 6:30 in ERC 405
*	Grant Writing - Wednesdays @ 6:30 in Baldwin 648 
*	General - Wednesdays @ 6 in CRC 3200

Again, feel free to reach out to me with questions and concerns at nijhawaa@mail.uc.edu.

"Army Career Opportunities ","Dear Brayden,

As your local U.S. Army representative, I would like to tell you about the many opportunities the Army has to offer. Whether your focus is attending college or joining the workforce, the Army has more than 150 career fields and numerous financial programs to help you make the most of your life.

Qualified Active Duty applicants can earn up to and over $100,000 for continuing education through the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, may qualify for a signing bonus of up to $40,000, and receive tuition assistance to pay for college while serving on Active Duty.

Qualified Reserves applicants can earn up to $26,000 for continuing education through the Reserves Montgomery G.I. Bill, up to $50,000 to repay student loans, tuition assistance to help pay for college, and may qualify for a signing bonus of up to $20,000. You can serve your country part time while pursuing a full time education.

Of course, the benefits of joining the U.S. Army go beyond just the monetary. In addition to becoming a stronger individual as you gain new training, you’ll also feel a sense of accomplishment, experience true camaraderie, and develop leadership skills employers value.

If you are interested in receiving more information about the U.S. Army or just have some questions, my contact information can be found below.

Very Respectfully

========= IT@UC Office of Information Security Alert Bulletin ========

**Email Phishing Alert**

A number of University of Cincinnati email users have recently reported receiving malicious emails, similar to the one below (see *Sample Phishing Email* below). TAKE CAUTION! The sender is not a representative of UC. The link they provide in the email does not lead to UC’s network, even though it appears to be a valid hyperlink. Access to the malicious site from the UC’s network has been blocked, but be aware that access can still be made via other networks, including non-UC wireless networks. Please remember that even if the message is from a valid UC mail account that does not mean that it should automatically be trusted! 

What is Phishing?

Phishing is the act of attempting to acquire information such as usernames, passwords, credit card and/or banking details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity by electronic communication (typically email).

What if I Received a Suspicious Email?

UC’s spam filters appear to have caught the majority of the malicious messages. If you have received a suspicious email, do not click on any links, fill out any forms or reply! All you have to do is delete the email.

"[CEAS-UG] Engineers Without Borders Meeting - 8/29 at 6 pm, CRC 3200.","Hello everyone! 




The first Engineers Without Borders general meeting is on Wednesday at 6 pm in CRC 3200. 




Engineers Without Borders aims to build a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic human needs and equip leaders to solve the world's most pressing challenges. 




At EWB UC, we are currently working on two solar-powered water distribution projects and one health and sanitation project in northern Tanzania. Not only do we develop our own designs, but we also travel to Tanzania to implement our projects! 




If you are interested, please come join us at our first general meeting. We will have snacks and will be giving you an introduction to our projects, as well as doing an awesome challenge! No prior engineering experience is required - this is a good chance to develop your CAD skills! 




At 5:50 pm, members in EWB shirts will be walking you to the meeting from these locations:

*	Baldwin Lobby (near the table on the left)
*	In front of Center Court




If you would like more information or cannot make it general meetings but would still like to be involved, please reach out to me at nijhawaa@mail.uc.edu. Our committees meet at different times that might work you.

CELEBRATING 200 YEARS
	
	
 <https://t.e2ma.net/click/tki2o/987qhk/l2e57c> 

Dear UC Community, 

Every new academic year is a very special time, but this year holds even more meaning, filled with a significance that comes only once in a lifetime and bonds all Bearcats across the centuries. The 2018-19 school year marks the rare opportunity to join together and celebrate the extraordinary milestone of our Bicentennial <https://t.e2ma.net/click/tki2o/987qhk/1uf57c> .

UC’s “Boldly Bearcat” Bicentennial rejoices in 200 years of groundbreaking moments with an eye to the future. I hope you will join us for the many festivities we have planned over the next 14 months. We begin with Homecoming on Oct. 6 and continue with Charter Week Jan. 15-19, Community Week April 1-6, Homecoming in autumn 2019, and a signature event on Nov. 9, 2019 – two centuries to the day since the first day of classes in what was then a small college in a frontier town. 

Then and Now
While the entering class in 1819 consisted of 70 students taught by three faculty, today’s enrollment is expected to be our sixth consecutive year of record enrollment – topping 45,000. New full-time and visiting faculty just arriving to campus for the new year number 170, joining UC’s distinguished full- and part-time faculty of 6,347. 

From humble origins, UC has risen to become a 21st-century global destination campus. As a Carnegie Research 1 university, UC is recognized for its top-ranked programs, enriching experience-based learning opportunities, inspiring creativity and leading-edge discoveries. Two recent UC faculty achievements speak to our stature today: a $30 million award from the National Institutes of Health to pioneering researchers and clinicians in the Department of Emergency Medicine to enhance stroke treatments, and the newly opened interdisciplinary Ohio Cyber Range at UC, awarded more than $2 million in funding to thwart cyberattacks and enhance personal and national cyber security.

This year, we welcome our first incoming new class with a majority born in the 2000s and numbering more than 7,700 across our three campuses. Our new baccalaureate students are making history as UC’s smartest and most academically prepared first-year class ever. 

I’m also proud to say that this fall, for the fourth straight year, UC’s undergraduate tuition remains frozen. As an urban public university, UC takes access and affordability to heart and will continue to identify efficiencies to keep costs in check.

1819 and Next Lives Here
This fall also marks the grand opening of our 1819 innovation hub, an anchor for Cincinnati’s Innovation District and our front door to connect UC students and faculty with industry and non-profit partners to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Aligned to our Next Lives Here strategic vision <https://t.e2ma.net/click/tki2o/987qhk/hng57c> , we have announced plans to further bend the future in Cincinnati’s direction with a digital futures research commons, also to be located in the Innovation District.

Building further on our Next Lives Here vision, our platforms and pathways continue to make progress, moving from an accelerated discovery phase into implementation mode. For example, our Faculty Enrichment Center task force has gathered data and input from faculty and other institutions, and the university’s recent participation in the COACHE survey will guide development of the center’s programming and resources, including virtual offerings. Its work will ensure that UC continues to attract, support and retain the world’s best faculty. 

Community Grants
Consistent with our identity as an urban-based university, our special Bicentennial Community Grants Project focuses on community engagement. Up to $100,000 in grants ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 will be announced this year, to invest in projects involving UC students and faculty while celebrating and extending UC’s urban impact in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. 

New on Campus
Just as change has been a constant at UC since its very founding, this year brings new and improved spaces that enhance our university’s impact. A new residential and office building, Marian Spencer Hall, has opened on the footprint of the old Sawyer Hall. The UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute will open in April, bringing together more than a dozen life-saving and life-changing specialties. The College-Conservatory of Music has completed $15 million in renovations to its major Corbett Center performance halls, while the new $120 million Lindner College of Business continues to take shape with completion expected in May, and the $61 million Health Sciences Building advances toward an opening in August 2019.  

Also appropriately timed during this “Boldly Bearcat” celebration, we reopen our newly revamped Fifth Third Arena. It will host our men’s basketball opener on Nov. 7 with an historic matchup not seen on campus for 99 years as the Bearcats take on Ohio State.

All of this gives just a glimpse of what the 2018-19 academic year holds in store. As we celebrate 200 years of UC impact, the optimism, determination and commitment to excellence that have been the university’s hallmarks will continue to drive us forward in our mission to provide our students with a strong foundation to build the bold tomorrow. 

What an honor it is be part of the UC community at this momentous time.

We are Boldly Bearcat!

"[CEAS-UG] UC Robotics Team General Meeting","Hello everybody,

You are invited to attend the first meeting of the semester for the University of Cincinnati Robotics Team. Being a part of the team is a fantastic chance to get practical, hands-on experience and work on projects beyond what would be covered in the classroom. No experience is required to join. All you need is an interest in any of the many aspects of robotics such as Linux, programming, 3D-printing, and electrical and mechanical design.

The first meeting will be held Wednesday, August 29 at 7:15 p.m. in Room 755 of Baldwin Hall. The following meetings will be located in 757 Baldwin. During this meeting, we will introduce you to the team’s work as we share the results of this summer’s robotics competition, discuss other potential projects for this year, and give a tour of our lab.

About the Team
The University of Cincinnati Robotics Team is part of the UC Center for Robotics Research. The team works with students to teach them the basics of robotics while providing opportunities to develop their skills with programming and robotic design. The team meets every Wednesday evening at 7:15 in the team lab located at 755 Baldwin. The team’s primary projects this year include:



*	Dokalman – Dokalman is the team's autonomous navigation robot. The robotics team competes each year in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition against teams from all around the world. This year we will be building an entirely new version of Dokalman.
	
*	The T-Shirt Cannon – Perhaps you've seen the t-shirt cannon in action during a UC basketball or football game. The Robotics team is looking for a group of dedicated students to take on this project. 
	


If you have any questions or are interested in joining the team but can't attend this week's meeting, several members of the team can be found in the lab all throughout the week working on different projects. You can also email the team at uc.robotics.team@gmail.com <mailto:uc.robotics.team@gmail.com> . 

Please go and join the team via campus link at https://campuslink.uc.edu/organization/university-of-cincinnati-robotics-team.


We hope to see you on Wednesday.

"[CEAS-UG] Wooo Hooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","CEAS PEOPLES!!!!!!!!!!!  It is beginning…or beginning again on Monday!

 

First. Wanted to introduce myself. Gretchen Hart. New Undergraduate Advising Director here in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I’m not new to UC through. I’ve been at UC for the last 15 years or so. Originally from Wisconsin. Yes. A Packers football fan. And I could eat buffalo chicken dip every day until the world runs out of Frank’s Hot Sauce.  I do not do pictures typically, but if you see a live action person in the halls that looks like this…it is me:

 



Please say hi and introduce yourself. I dig students….which is why I do what I do. So don’t be shy.

 

Second. Know that I will be reaching out to some of you for focus groups to discuss advising in CEAS as well as the culture here in the college. Stay tuned. And because you all don’t get enough surveys *wink* I will more than likely send out another one to gather similar information. Get psyched. I promise I’ll make the survey short. I/we truly want to know about your experiences here in CEAS and UC and want to explore opportunities for change as well as enhance the stuff we’re doing right. We care about your wellbeing and your path and I want to make sure we are supporting you the way you wish to be supported.

 

Third. I wish you all the very best this next year. I know CEAS students are hard workers. Please remember to HALT though and take care of yourself along the way. HALT = Hungry Angry Lonely Tired  So. Eat some good foods. Let yourself be angry and then breath it out/walk it off. Recognize when you are feeling lonely and reach out to peers, faculty, and us! And sleep. Dudes. Sleep. It is a must. Please be sure when you are getting fuzzy brain and/or slow bodies that you are making time for some good rest. 

 

Happy School Year. I really look forward to sharing this year with you.

 

PS. All of your advisors are doing Walk-in Hours next week if you have any last minute “emergencies” and you need to meet with them. Do not be shy about walking in next week to settle any issues.

"Fall Elective Courses still available","UC FORWARD: WHY WAIT TO CHANGE THE WORLD!!!

Today, more than ever, innovative problem solving relies on cross-disciplinary collaboration among teams of practitioners and extensive engagement between stakeholders and service providers. Indeed, aptitude in thinking beyond traditional, disciplinary-approaches to the design and implementation of solutions is key to true innovation. 

Our flagship course Inquiry to Innovation focuses students on the creative process of research and innovation as well as collaborative cross-disciplinary teamwork necessary to address specific and real-world urban problems. Each term, Inquiry to Innovation partners with a different community, business, or industry leader to help them solve a problem unique to their organization. Returning coops who have experience in workplace settings are well prepared for these innovation courses.

"[SAFETYNOTICE] Welcome to the UC Campus Community!","Dear Student,

 

Welcome to the University of Cincinnati! The fall semester is upon us and with that comes various opportunities for socialization, on and off campus. As a Bearcat, we are expected to be responsible citizens, on and off-campus. As such, we need to be mindful and conscious of our behaviors within our communities. We invite you to take the time to read our Student Code of Conduct, which outlines your rights and responsibilities as students in promoting a positive, safe living and learning environment. 

 

As new and returning Bearcats, please be cognizant of unknown individuals contacting and requesting information (i.e. scams, catfishing) from you via e-mail, social media, and video chats. The University of Cincinnati also encourages you to “Mind What Matters.” As the semester begins, be sure to take precautions to reduce your risk of being a victim of common crimes on campus, particularly theft. For more information, go to www.uc.edu/publicsafety/mindwhatmatters <http://www.uc.edu/publicsafety/mindwhatmatters> . In addition, our first home football game is fast approaching and many students, alumni and guests will be returning to campus and Nippert Stadium. UC is committed to your safety on and off campus and in the Uptown community. 

 

As a member of our University it is our responsibility to help others. If you witness a crime in progress, call 911. If you observe any suspicious activity, contact UC Police at 513-556-1111, or Cincinnati Police at 513-765-1212. With regard to sexual assault reporting and resources, please contact UC Police at the number above or UC’s Title IX office at 513-556-3349. For confidential support, please contact the Women Helping Women On-Campus Advocates at 513-556-4418.  The On-Campus advocates support any student regardless of gender or gender identity.  Finally, if you have questions or concerns about the behavior of a UC student, please contact the Dean of Students’ Office at 513-556-4119. 

 

Together, let’s have a positive impact on campus and in our local community! Go Bearcats!

**Email Phishing Alert**

A number of University of Cincinnati email users have recently reported receiving malicious emails, similar to the one below (see *Sample Phishing Email* below). TAKE CAUTION! The sender is not a representative of UC. The link they provide in the email does not lead to UC’s network, even though it appears to be a valid hyperlink. Access to the malicious site from the UC’s network has been blocked, but be aware that access can still be made via other networks, including non-UC wireless networks. Please remember that even if the message is from a valid UC mail account that does not mean that it should automatically be trusted! 

What is Phishing?

Phishing is the act of attempting to acquire information such as usernames, passwords, credit card and/or banking details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity by electronic communication (typically email).

What if I Received a Suspicious Email?

UC’s spam filters appear to have caught the majority of the malicious messages. If you have received a suspicious email, do not click on any links, fill out any forms or reply! All you have to do is delete the email.

"[CEAS-EECS-UG] Student project from Siemens","Forwarded Message! 

Do not respond to the listserv. If you want more information about this opportunity, you must contact Isha Punjabi whose contact information appears below

We have an exciting challenge from Siemens up on MindSumo and they would love to see your students solve it!

MindSumo is a platform that provides real company projects for students to help them develop professional skills and valuable experiences for resumes. We have worked with over 350 companies in the past and have over 300,000 students in our community. 

Siemens - How can we better control mass air flow in rotating machinery? 

These challenges are great for students who want to apply skills they learnt during their classes to solve projects for actual companies. Great to work on during their weekend, after school, during breaks and even as a class project. Each of these challenges also award the top performers with cash prizes.

Would you please forward my note to students and professors you think might be interested in such projects?

"[UC-CCE] Weekly Service Update: Join A Service-Based Student Group!","Hello!

 

We are looking forward to seeing you back on campus in just a few short weeks. Get a jump start on thinking about service, and consider joining one of these awesome student groups to find like-minded people and meaningful volunteer opportunities:

 

1girl

Who We Are: 1girl sends groups of UC facilitators to Dater High School to lead a unique curriculum designed to empower young girls to develop the skills they need to be successful.

When We Meet: Meetings will be every other Tuesdays at either 4PM or 5PM, and the location is TBD.

How You Can Be Involved: 1girl has an executive board, facilitators, and general body members.  The executive board works to improve the chapter, the facilitators go into the schools to work with the 8th grade girls through the provided curriculum, and the general body members learn about 1girl by participating in a Women’s Circle in order to potentially become a facilitator or chair/executive member.

Upcoming Events: 1girl will be at the Community Service Fair and Student Organization Fair for Welcome Weekend. Our retreat to kick off the year will be the evening of September 4th!

Learn more: http://1girl.org/

Bearcat Coders

Who We Are: ACM-W is a computer science club on campus that focuses on education, professional development and women empowerment (you don't have to be a woman to join though!). We would love for you to volunteer with our Bearcat Coders program! Bearcat Coders is a tutoring/mentoring program that we host to encourage local elementary school and high school students to pursue their interests in technology. We currently serve 2 volunteering locations (Hughes STEM High School and Corryville Catholic Elementary School).

When We Meet: Meetings for ACM-W are every other Thursday after September 6th at 6:30 pm. You can find more information about our meetings on our website at acmwuc.com.

What We Expect: As a member of ACM-W, we expect you to show up to meetings whenever you can and have fun! If you wish to volunteer for Bearcat Coders, you are expected to mentor for an hour a week at one of our partner schools (which are a walking distance from main campus). No prior coding experience/knowledge is necessary- although you can learn to code along with the students. You can be more engaged with the program if you would like- it’s highly encouraged! :) Volunteering with us qualifies for service hours for scholarships like Cincinnatus.  

Upcoming Events: We are having our Bearcat Coders Kickoff meeting on September 26th at 6:30 pm where we will eat some food and talk about the program! This is a great chance to meet other prospective volunteers and learn more about what we have planned for the semester.

Founded in January 2015 by a small group of motivated UC students, CUC has grown from 350 to over 1,000 volunteers each semester. We engage in large scale clean up events ranging from typical litter removal, to actual waterway restoration and tree planting.

When We Meet: Our executive board meets weekly in TUC, but those interested in taking part in our events should like us on Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/CleanUpCincy/> /favorite our organization on volunteer.uc.edu <https://volunteer.uc.edu/agency/detail/?agency_id=48887>  so that you get updates when we make new events available.

What We Expect: We are actively recruiting several director positions which can be found on the website: cleanupcincy.com <https://www.cleanupcincy.com/> . We expect our directors to commit to weekly meetings and carry out their tasks in a timely manner. Those just looking to take part in our clean-ups are simply expected to show up, contribute with effort, and enjoy themselves! 

Upcoming Events: Our next big event is coming up quickly on October 13th. With a backup  day on the 20th. Sign up will be available on Volunteer.uc.edu in the coming weeks.

Design in Mind

Who We Are: Design in Mind is a partnership with Cincinnati Public Schools where creative UC students volunteer weekly in local elementary art classrooms to assist with daily classroom activities, encourage creativity, and introduce kids to creative careers.

When We Meet: To be determined. Design in mind is committed to making sure meetings are attend-able to all who want to take part.

What We Expect: Students, when taking part in Design in Mind, are required to be at schools at their assigned time, whenever classes are in session. Failure to follow through with this commitment would mean that students at Cincinnati Public Schools do not get the attention they need for Design in Mind's goal to be effective. Failure to comply would mean that all service hours for the semester would be denied.

Upcoming Events: Who we are style meet and greet: 9/5 Time 1:00 in the 6th floor studio, DAAP -- Come hang out with us and get to know what Design in Mind is all about. // Our first official Volunteer Meeting: 9/12 1:00, in the 6th floor studio, DAAP

Students will design their own new products, advertisements, and product packaging throughout the semester using creativity and problem solving to redesign and fix some of the greatest product failures in history.

About the U.S. Foreign Service

Foreign Service Officers in the U.S. Department of State are responsible for formulating, implementing and supporting U.S. foreign policy.

They are engaged in foreign policy issues such as conflict resolution, human rights, environmental and health issues, nuclear nonproliferation, and educational exchange. A Foreign Service career is much more than just a job; it is a uniquely demanding and rewarding way of life. Foreign Service Officers work in Washington and in more than 250 diplomatic posts worldwide. As representatives of the United States, Foreign Service Officers have a direct impact on people’s lives, witness history in the making, and help create and implement U.S. policy.

8. Crossroad Health Center Volunteer Internship Program Fall 2018 Application Cycle

 

The Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program is targeted toward pre-medical and pre-health students who are interested in gaining real, hands-on experience at a primary care clinic in a low-income community. This includes a balance of clinical tasks which provide interns with invaluable experiences and non-clinical tasks that improve the standard of care at Crossroad. We are looking for hardworking, dedicated, and reliable individuals who conduct themselves professionally. 

 

This is a wonderful opportunity but also a large commitment of time and energy, which is important to keep in mind when applying. Volunteer interns are required to commit to one year of weekly shifts totaling 8 hours per week.

 

The next application cycle for interns who will join the program in September 2018 will begin on August 1, 2018. Applications will be open online until August 19, 2018 at 11:59 PM. Interviews will be held on Saturday, September 8, 2018. Please visit our website for details regarding the application process and the Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program as a whole: http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html <http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html> .

Thank you for letting me know, Brayden.  If you would like to discuss ways to fit UHP into your schedule, I’d be happy to have that conversation with you.  However, if you are firm in your decision, I understand and will remove you from the program.  I wish you all the best with your future endeavors!

Meghan,

 

Thank you for reaching out. I apologize for not responding sooner. I would like to remove myself from the University Honors Program. While I appreciate everything that it has done for me, I do not feel that I will be able to participate in an active schedule of honors experiences while also maintaining an acceptable level of focus in my chosen field. 

 

Again, I apologize for not emailing you to say this earlier. Is there anything that I can do to make transitioning out of UHP an easier process for myself or you?

 

Thank you, 

Brayden Osborne

Hello,

 

I reached out about a month ago to say that you were not in good standing with UHP and how to return to good standing by July 5.  It looks as if you did not complete those tasks.  Please refer back to the email I sent you and make sure that your next steps are complete by August 1, or I will need to remove you from the program.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions!

UNIVERSITY HONORS ANNOUNCEMENTS

1.  NEW – Fall Seminar – HNRS 3076- The Bard Abides: Shakespeare in the Everyday World


For over four hundred years, the works of William Shakespeare have been adapted around the globe to remain relevant to each generation. This seminar goes beyond reading the plays to examine instead the Shakespeare effect in humor, politics, insults, gender issues, world politics, and cross-cultural understanding. For example, how is the Arab world of Shakespeare different than that of China or South Africa?  How have Star Wars and Dr. Who been influenced by Shakespeare’s characters?  What is involved in stage fighting, costume and set design, and dialogue changes?  And what do witches, race and war, mythology, poisonous plants, and cross-dressing have to do with Shakespeare? In a collaborative environment, we will engage in fresh, hands-on ways of looking at Shakespeare on the stage and in their daily lives, work with rare and unique volumes in the Archives & Rare Books Library, and create innovative learning modules for middle school, high school, and college students.

Day/Time: W 3:35 – 6:20 pm

2. NEW – Fall Seminar - The Good Life - And How to Live It


All of us dream of living “the good life,” though the mental images we have of it differ. But what is the good life and what do we need to do to be sure that our own life is a good one? From the dawn of civilization, philosophers, theologians and poets have conceptualized the good life and recommended ways to achieve it. They have tried to teach us how to live happily and well. In this Honors Seminar, we encounter some of the most influential thinkers who have dealt with the questions surrounding happiness and good living over more than two millennia. We read and discuss their thoughts as a way to help us develop our own philosophy of happiness and good living – a philosophy that will inform our personal life choices, console us when we encounter life’s difficulties, and guide us in our roles as friends and engaged citizens who care about the happiness of others.

Selected fellows will receive support for graduate school and will enter into exciting and rewarding careers representing the United States overseas.

Program Benefits

·         An orientation to the Program and the Foreign Service at Howard University in Washington, D.C. in late spring 2019.

·         Two summer internships, one on Capitol Hill in summer 2019 and one overseas at a U.S. embassy in summer 2020.

·         Up to $37,500 annually toward tuition, fees and living expenses for a two-year master’s degree in fields related to the Foreign Service such as Business Administration, Economics, Public Policy, and International Relations at a U.S.-based institution.

·         Mentoring from a Foreign Service Officer throughout the duration of the fellowship.

·         Employment in the State Department Foreign Service for those who successfully complete the program and meet Foreign Service entry requirements, in accordance with applicable law and State Department policy, with each Rangel Fellow committing to a minimum of five years of service.

Eligibility Requirements

*	U.S. citizenship
*	Seeking admission to graduate school in fall 2019 for a two-year program in an area of relevance to the Foreign Service at a U.S.-based institution

About the U.S. Foreign Service

Foreign Service Officers in the U.S. Department of State are responsible for formulating, implementing and supporting U.S. foreign policy. Their work includes analyzing political and economic events around the world; negotiating with foreign governments; assisting U.S. citizens abroad; educating foreign audiences about American culture and values; and managing an embassy’s operations. They are engaged in foreign policy issues such as conflict resolution, human rights, environmental and health issues, nuclear nonproliferation, and educational exchange. A Foreign Service career is much more than just a job; it is a uniquely demanding and rewarding way of life. Foreign Service Officers work in Washington and in more than 250 diplomatic posts worldwide. As representatives of the United States, Foreign Service Officers have a direct impact on people’s lives, witness history in the making, and help create and implement U.S. policy.

5. NEW - Crossroad Health Center Volunteer Internship Program Fall 2018 Application Cycle

 

The Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program is targeted toward pre-medical and pre-health students who are interested in gaining real, hands-on experience at a primary care clinic in a low-income community. This includes a balance of clinical tasks which provide interns with invaluable experiences and non-clinical tasks that improve the standard of care at Crossroad. We are looking for hardworking, dedicated, and reliable individuals who conduct themselves professionally. 

 

This is a wonderful opportunity but also a large commitment of time and energy, which is important to keep in mind when applying. Volunteer interns are required to commit to one year of weekly shifts totaling 8 hours per week.

 

The next application cycle for interns who will join the program in September 2018 will begin on August 1, 2018. Applications will be open online until August 19, 2018 at 11:59 PM. Interviews will be held on Saturday, September 8, 2018. Please visit our website for details regarding the application process and the Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program as a whole: http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html <http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html> .

"[UC-CCE] Monthly Update 7-18-2018","Good morning!

 

We hope you are having a great summer! We have a few opportunities to share with you. Read on if you want to keep Cincinnati beautiful or apply for a prestigious healthcare internship!

 

Help Reduce Waste During Move-Out Season!

THE PROBLEM: Moving out can generate an excessive amount of waste. In Uptown, most leases end around July 31st, so students and families are cleaning out to move during that week. In the past, this has caused a lot of furniture, trash, and other items to be left on the street or overflowing in dumpsters. In order to prevent this from happening, to divert waste from the landfill, reduce blight, and provide goods for those in need, Uptown is offering extra trash dumpsters, recycling containers, and St. Vincent de Paul donation trailers during this time. 

 

VOLUNTEER: We are looking for volunteers to be at each drop off location (2915 Clifton Ave and 2823 Eden Ave) to staff the collection and ensure that items are placed in the proper containers. We will provide all the information you will need along with supervisors who will be visiting both locations. Hours are 9am to 6pm daily for the weeks of July 25th to Sunday August 5th.

 

To sign up please visit: https://volunteer.uc.edu/need/detail/?need_id=355029

 

Keep Cincinnati Beautiful Wants Your Opinions!

This is a 2-minute survey about Keep Cincinnati Beautiful, a non-profit organization that provides education, revitalization and environmental initiatives to build community and foster pride in Cincinnati. They also partner with Clean Up Cincy! Your answers will help KCB grow and make Cincinnati a better place. We greatly appreciate your feedback.

 

Here is the public link to the survey: http://cincinnati.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0lBrZCVxMzWprhP (The deadline for the survey is next Tuesday, July 24th)

 

Apply for an Internship at Crossroads Health Center!

 

The Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program is targeted toward pre-medical and pre-health students who are interested in gaining real, hands-on experience at a primary care clinic in a low-income community. This includes a balance of clinical tasks which provide interns with invaluable experiences and non-clinical tasks that improve the standard of care at Crossroad. We are looking for hardworking, dedicated, and reliable individuals who conduct themselves professionally. 

 

The next application cycle for interns who will join the program in September 2018 will begin on August 1, 2018. Applications will be open online until August 19, 2018 at 11:59 PM. Interviews will be held on Saturday, September 8, 2018. Please visit our website for details regarding the application process and the Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program as a whole: http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html <http://www.crossroadhc.org/volunteer-internship-program.html> . To read about the experiences of students in this program, please visit our blog at crossroadhc.blogspot.com <http://crossroadhc.blogspot.com/> .

 

This is a wonderful opportunity but also a large commitment of time and energy, which is important to keep in mind when applying. Volunteer interns are required to commit to one year of weekly shifts totaling 8 hours per week.

 

Best wishes,

2. NEW – Fall Seminar – HNRS 3076- The Bard Abides: Shakespeare in the Everyday World


For over four hundred years, the works of William Shakespeare have been adapted around the globe to remain relevant to each generation. This seminar goes beyond reading the plays to examine instead the Shakespeare effect in humor, politics, insults, gender issues, world politics, and cross-cultural understanding. For example, how is the Arab world of Shakespeare different than that of China or South Africa?  How have Star Wars and Dr. Who been influenced by Shakespeare’s characters?  What is involved in stage fighting, costume and set design, and dialogue changes?  And what do witches, race and war, mythology, poisonous plants, and cross-dressing have to do with Shakespeare? In a collaborative environment, we will engage in fresh, hands-on ways of looking at Shakespeare on the stage and in their daily lives, work with rare and unique volumes in the Archives & Rare Books Library, and create innovative learning modules for middle school, high school, and college students.

3. NEW – Fall Seminar - The Good Life - And How to Live It


All of us dream of living “the good life,” though the mental images we have of it differ. But what is the good life and what do we need to do to be sure that our own life is a good one? From the dawn of civilization, philosophers, theologians and poets have conceptualized the good life and recommended ways to achieve it. They have tried to teach us how to live happily and well. In this Honors Seminar, we encounter some of the most influential thinkers who have dealt with the questions surrounding happiness and good living over more than two millennia. We read and discuss their thoughts as a way to help us develop our own philosophy of happiness and good living – a philosophy that will inform our personal life choices, console us when we encounter life’s difficulties, and guide us in our roles as friends and engaged citizens who care about the happiness of others.

"Blackboard Outage Update","Greetings,

 

On Friday July 6th at approximately 3:30 p.m. the Blackboard system went offline. Upon investigation of the root cause, data corruption was detected.

 

IT@UC service administrators made several attempts overnight to repair the Blackboard database, but were unsuccessful. In the interest of restoring service as soon as possible, Blackboard will be “rolled back” to the state that it was in just prior to the data corruption (approximately 2:30 a.m. on Friday, July 6).

 

As a result, any work done in Blackboard on July 6 should be considered lost. Any grades, discussion board posts, assignments, content changes etc. that were submitted on July 6 will need to be resubmitted. 

 

Restoring Blackboard service is IT@UC’s immediate priority, and we anticipate that it will be available by 11:00 p.m. this evening. Please contact the IT@UC Service Desk at (513) 556-4357 (select option 3) if you need assistance or have specific questions.

 

We apologize for the continued inconvenience and will update you when service is restored.

"[CEAS-EE-SO] create your email signature","Dear CMPE and EE students,

 

Creating an email signature that will appear on all of your communications with UC offices can help faculty and staff identify and serve you more quickly and effectively.  Having your information in your signature line enables everyone from Financial Aid, Housing, advising, etc. to assist you more quickly because they don’t have to email you back and forth for this information.  CEAS advisors have begun working with freshman during our orientation sessions to have them create their email signatures, and I thought you might benefit by doing this, too!

 

Your signature should include:

 

Full Name

M Number

Major

Class of 20xx

 

Here is how it works:

 

Create your email signature line:

1.	Select Options (gear icon) in the top right corner
2.	Look for My app settings at the bottom. Select Mail.
3.	On the left side of the screen, Scroll down to the Layout section. Select Email Signature.

 

Create your signature line and save.

Make sure to the check both “Automatically include my signature…” boxes.

We’re announcing a UHP T-Shirt Design Contest to celebrate 10 Years as the University Honors Program. That’s right! Ten years ago, we embarked on developing a whole new vision that brought honors education formally out of the classroom and into the world through experience-based opportunities. We want to commemorate that moment with some new UHP swag designed by a UHP student. 

 

Design Criteria (also see attached flyer):

 

*       Include the idea of ‘Global Citizen Scholar’ somewhere in the design

*       Also celebrates 10 years as the University Honors Program

*       Uses a 1 or 2 color design (not including the background color). See samples in the poster.

*       If you use UC logos, know the university brand guide:  http://www.uc.edu/ucomm/brand.html.

*       Vector art is preferred but not required.

*       Always refer to the program as ‘University Honors’ or the ‘University Honors Program.’ Just honors will be disqualified.

 

Participants may submit up to three entries by July 9 to Jason at Jason.autry@uc.edu <mailto:Jason.autry@uc.edu> . Any questions may also be directed to Jason. 

 

The winning design may need to be slightly edited to adhere to branding standards and t-shirt needs. Don’t worry so much about these, because we’ll help make the conversion happen. Just focus on making a design you and your peers would be proud to wear! 

 

The winning design will be developed into the latest UHP swag given out starting fall 2018.

UNIVERSITY HONORS ANNOUNCEMENTS

__________________________________________________________


1. NEW – Fall Seminar – HNRS 3076- The Bard Abides: Shakespeare in the Everyday World


For over four hundred years, the works of William Shakespeare have been adapted around the globe to remain relevant to each generation. This seminar goes beyond reading the plays to examine instead the Shakespeare effect in humor, politics, insults, gender issues, world politics, and cross-cultural understanding. For example, how is the Arab world of Shakespeare different than that of China or South Africa?  How have Star Wars and Dr. Who been influenced by Shakespeare’s characters?  What is involved in stage fighting, costume and set design, and dialogue changes?  And what do witches, race and war, mythology, poisonous plants, and cross-dressing have to do with Shakespeare? In a collaborative environment, we will engage in fresh, hands-on ways of looking at Shakespeare on the stage and in their daily lives, work with rare and unique volumes in the Archives & Rare Books Library, and create innovative learning modules for middle school, high school, and college students.

BoK: DC, HU

Day/Time: W 3:35 – 6:20 pm

2. NEW – Fall Seminar - The Good Life - And How to Live It


All of us dream of living “the good life,” though the mental images we have of it differ. But what is the good life and what do we need to do to be sure that our own life is a good one? From the dawn of civilization, philosophers, theologians and poets have conceptualized the good life and recommended ways to achieve it. They have tried to teach us how to live happily and well. In this Honors Seminar, we encounter some of the most influential thinkers who have dealt with the questions surrounding happiness and good living over more than two millennia. We read and discuss their thoughts as a way to help us develop our own philosophy of happiness and good living – a philosophy that will inform our personal life choices, console us when we encounter life’s difficulties, and guide us in our roles as friends and engaged citizens who care about the happiness of others.

Do you want to learn how to enable remote diagnostics and predictive maintenance for your electric drives and other Industrial IoT applications? 

This webinar will introduce the foundational concepts motivating the use of Xilinx Zynq® SoCs in Electric Drives applications building up to how Python on Zynq, or PYNQ, can enable software engineers and data scientists to easily gain valuable on-chip, real-time insights from data generated by the motor, with or without cloud connectivity. The key differentiation with PYNQ lies in the configurable hardware pre-processing of sensor data leading to the most efficient use of the application software.

Within the hour, you will learn: 

*	Why Xilinx for Industrial IoT Edge Platforms, using the example of modern Electric Drives
*	Introduction to the speed and simplicity of the PYNQ Framework including Hardware Overlays, Jupyter Notebooks, and supported Python libraries
*	How PYNQ can enable remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and the digital twin concept
*	How to get started with PYNQ with links to kits, videos, papers, and community designs

1. NEW – Fall Seminar – HNRS 3076- The Bard Abides: Shakespeare in the Everyday World


For over four hundred years, the works of William Shakespeare have been adapted around the globe to remain relevant to each generation. This seminar goes beyond reading the plays to examine instead the Shakespeare effect in humor, politics, insults, gender issues, world politics, and cross-cultural understanding. For example, how is the Arab world of Shakespeare different than that of China or South Africa?  How have Star Wars and Dr. Who been influenced by Shakespeare’s characters?  What is involved in stage fighting, costume and set design, and dialogue changes?  And what do witches, race and war, mythology, poisonous plants, and cross-dressing have to do with Shakespeare? In a collaborative environment, we will engage in fresh, hands-on ways of looking at Shakespeare on the stage and in their daily lives, work with rare and unique volumes in the Archives & Rare Books Library, and create innovative learning modules for middle school, high school, and college students.

2. NEW – Fall Seminar - The Good Life - And How to Live It


All of us dream of living “the good life,” though the mental images we have of it differ. But what is the good life and what do we need to do to be sure that our own life is a good one? From the dawn of civilization, philosophers, theologians and poets have conceptualized the good life and recommended ways to achieve it. They have tried to teach us how to live happily and well. In this Honors Seminar, we encounter some of the most influential thinkers who have dealt with the questions surrounding happiness and good living over more than two millennia. We read and discuss their thoughts as a way to help us develop our own philosophy of happiness and good living – a philosophy that will inform our personal life choices, console us when we encounter life’s difficulties, and guide us in our roles as friends and engaged citizens who care about the happiness of others.

3. NEW - University Honors T-Shirt Design Contest Announcement

We’re announcing a UHP T-Shirt Design Contest to celebrate 10 Years as the University Honors Program. That’s right! Ten years ago, we embarked on developing a whole new vision that brought honors education formally out of the classroom and into the world through experience-based opportunities. We want to commemorate that moment with some new UHP swag designed by a UHP student. 

 

Design Criteria (also see attached flyer):

 

*         Include the idea of ‘Global Citizen Scholar’ somewhere in the design

*         Also celebrates 10 years as the University Honors Program

*         Uses a 1 or 2 color design (not including the background color). See samples in the poster.

*         If you use UC logos, know the university brand guide:  http://www.uc.edu/ucomm/brand.html.

*         Vector art is preferred but not required.

"[UC-UNIVHONORS] University Honors T-Shirt Design Contest Announcement","A Contest for UHP students! Read below for details. 



Hello!

 

We’re announcing a UHP T-Shirt Design Contest to celebrate 10 Years as the University Honors Program. That’s right! Ten years ago, we embarked on developing a whole new vision that brought honors education formally out of the classroom and into the world through experience-based opportunities. We want to commemorate that moment with some new UHP swag designed by a UHP student. 

 

As the poster says, here’s the required criteria:

*         Includes the idea of ‘Global Citizen Scholar’ somewhere in the design

*         Also celebrates 10 years as the University Honors Program

*         Uses a 1 or 2 color design (not including the background color). See samples in the poster.

*         If you use UC logos, know the university brand guide:  http://www.uc.edu/ucomm/brand.html.

*         Vector art is preferred but not required.

*         Always refer to the program as ‘University Honors’ or the ‘University Honors Program.’ Just honors will be disqualified.

 

Participants may submit up to three entries by July 9 to Jason at Jason.autry@uc.edu <mailto:Jason.autry@uc.edu> . Any questions may also be directed to Jason. 

 

The winning design may need to be slightly edited to adhere to branding standards and t-shirt needs. Don’t worry so much about these, because we’ll help make the conversion happen. Just focus on making a design you and your peers would be proud to wear! 

 

The winning design will be developed into the latest UHP swag given out starting fall 2018.
