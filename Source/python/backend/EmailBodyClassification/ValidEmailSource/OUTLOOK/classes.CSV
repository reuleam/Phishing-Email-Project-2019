	Chris,

	
	

	I misread the instructions on submitting the final project cor Coop Communications, and there is no option to re-submit it. I accidentally sent in the file as being named ""CommunicationGroup_Final.pdf"" when it should have been named ""BendeleSpragginsShawTruongOsborne.pdf"". So sorry for the mistake and please let me know if there's something I can do to fix it.

I haven't done anything solid, but I'd say a simple power point would be enough. I've made a simple frame for the power point. If you have any ideas       for it or want to make any changes, go ahead.

As for Monday, I am able to meet pretty much any time after 1:30 pm. 




Hope to see you then!

Hey guys,




So the final project presentation for the class is due this upcoming Tuesday and we haven't done anything for it yet. I know I'm leaving tonight for Thanksgiving, and I'm sure its gonna be busy for you guys too. Not sure if it will work for all of you but I think we need to get together on Monday to crank this thing out. If you guys have any ideas of what kind of thing we could do for the project that could be done in a couple hours on a single afternoon that would be awesome. 




Also, if you don't mind, please respond to this email with your phone number, and I'll make a groupme with everyone in it. 







Thanks,

Brayden

Sam, 

 

I just wanted to thank you again for letting me interview you.  Learning more about how interdisciplinary teams function and what it is like to work in government contracting was such an awesome opportunity. I feel like I have a clearer picture of the gaps in my own skill and how my strengths may play into a similar field. I am so grateful that you gave me your time, and the interview really gave me a lot of perspective on my own future. 

 

Thanks So Much,

Brayden

I am going to give  you a 50% for Lab09.  But you owe me by Monday preferred an updated implementation and report.  Just respond to this email with the new cxx file and the word doc.  An implementation of the PriorityQueue that doesn't use priorityQueue.   As I stated once we have covered an ADT, you can use the official STL version.   But for the PriorityQueue lab it is not OK to use the std::priority_queue.




Please redo the implementation, and redo the lab report.  I think you are going to see a reversal of which one is more efficient.

This week, we are going to do the parts of lab 8 that we did not do last week. As far as the report goes, you need to submit only one report due next Tuesday (Nov 6) for the entire lab 8 that contains the results of all experiments done in these two weeks. That means, you do not need to submit a report this week.

This will cause your anus not to adjust to the foreign objects you stick in it causing bleeding.

Step 2. Start off with the big stuff first.

                This will get your butthole acquainted with giant ass (pun intended) object being inside you butt.

Step 3. Just don’t cry like a little bitch.

I have posted the procedure and some notes for lab 7, DC biasing of Common Collector (CC) and Common Base (CB) amplifiers. I intended to upload it earlier, but it was not ready yet. With that said, it should be an easy lab and pre-work calculations are very similar to that of Common Emitter biasing we did last week.  

Good luck and see you in class on Wednesday,

There is no HW on the discrete convolution problem as of right now. The example is purely so that you have been exposed to the concept of discrete time covolution.

The results of your MatLab assignment have been posted and the solutions are posted as well in Chapter 2 Part 1.

For those of you that received a 7, your resulting convolution graph was not correct. This is because many of you multiplied x1(i-j) by e^-i when convolving. This is not correct because you are multiplying the shifted version  x(i-j) by e^-i. Instead you should have multiplied x1(i) by e^-i and then convolved.

Enjoy the homecoming weekend!

There were many mistakes in the lab briefs that I tried to ignore and not take off any points. However, I added my comments so you can avoid them in the upcoming reports. As we move forward, we expect the quality of reports to go up, so reoccurring mistakes will have a larger impact on the grades. 

Many mistakes could have been avoided if you read through the recent report template I posted on Blackboard (link below). There have also been new threads of questions and answers in the ""Discussion Board"" on BB that you can use in case you have similar questions. 

Lastly, I am going to extend the deadline for submission of lab 3  reports to Wednesday midnight so you would have enough time for making changes on your lab 3 report based on the feedback from graded lab 2 briefs. 

See you in class tomorrow,

"Re: Lab Brief Question","Brayden,
Yes, it should just be separate pages in the same PDF. Each team member includes his own version of pre-work in that file, so there should be one or two pages of prework per person.

Ashkan,




Your blackboard announcement says that we are to submit one lab brief for the group. How are we supposed to have separate analysis and conclusion? Should it just be separate pages in the same PDF? Also, do we only need one page of pre-work calculations as a group or individual pages?




Thanks,

""Question 4 on the prework of lab 2 states that you will need to record the values of the reverse current, Ir, in figure 3, however, these should be recorded in figure 6. I have notified Jason of the mistake.

Subject: Lab 1 Quiz Question 
 

Ashkan, 




On the lab one quiz, question 5, we are asked to figure out what voltage the multimeter is measuring, and the 'correct' answer is that it is measuring 'V-b'. However, point B is just a single point on a wire. I am not sure how the multimeter could be measuring the voltage at a single point when it is connected across multiple resistors. All of the other answers were measuring the voltage across multiple points such as 'V-ab' or 'V-bc'. Am I just misunderstanding the meaning of 'V-b'? If so, what is the meaning of this label?




Thank you,

Brayden Osborne

"2188-1_20EECE2070L002 ((18FS-Full) ELECTRONICS LAB I (002)): No Lab Next Wednesday and More Details","Hello All,

This may be the longest email I send out in the entire semester, but please read it carefully as it contains important information that we will follow for the entire semester:

*	The link for submitting Lab 1 brief is available (two attempts allowed). It is due the end of Tuesday, Sept 4. After that, the link will not be available. I will finish grading the briefs on Wednesday, Sept 12, so you'd be able to go through it and avoid similar mistakes in upcoming reports.
*	The lab brief template is posted on blackboard  ( /Course Documents/Templates and Data Sheets/Templates/Lab Brief Template ).  The submitted file should be a Single PDF containing the following items:

	1.	Page 1 is the page 1 of the template (your name, class day, etc.)
	2.	Page 2 is the page 2 of the template containing the lab objective (Write in your own words. DO NOT USE the same objective given to you on the lab write-ups).
	3.	Page 3 will be the scan of the completed lab write-up handed to you in class. Each  group member should also include a scanned copy of their calculations on a separate sheet (one sheet of calculations per group member). 
	4.	After page 3, you will have your simulation results (typically 2-5 pages). 
	5.	Next comes each team member's analysis (typically 2-4 pages) and conclusion (typically 1 to 3 pages)

*	Items 1-4 are shared sections (except the calculations sheet in item 3 which is one sheet per person). Item 5 (Analysis and Conclusion) is NOT a shared section meaning that each person writes his own analysis and conclusion and appends it to the end of the PDF file to be submitted.
*	There are many details that you need to pay attention to when writing a technical report after you get a job. Hence, we practice writing a quality report in this class. Make sure you read the file ""E1 Lab Brief Format.pdf"" posted on BB ( /Course Documents/Templates and Data Sheets/Templates/Lab Brief Format )  for a review of these details and accompanied examples.  
*	The sheet of calculations mentioned in item 3 of the lab brief template above is essentially your lab pre-work which starting from next lab, you will submit in a separate link before the class (due one hour before the class and done on an Engineering paper)
*	I have made discussion forums on the BB ( /Tools/Discussion Board ) to discuss questions related to lab brief/report and pre-work. Students who show good activity in the forums can claim extra credit added to their final grade.

One last important note, There will be no class on next Wednesday, Sept 5th. That is  because the Monday class is off, and I'd like to keep the Wednesday class on the same schedule as the Monday section.   
Let me know if any question.  
Have a nice weekend,
